<small>THE RUNAWAY CAR.</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Seems to me that the car is
running away.”</p>

<p>“It surely does. Gracious! Feel it lurch
then?”</p>

<p>As he spoke Jack Chadwick, a good-looking,
clean-cut lad of about seventeen, sprang to his
feet. His example was followed by his cousin,
Tom Jesson, a youth of his own age.</p>

<p>But the trolley car, at the same instant, gave a
bound and a side jump that hurled the boys
against each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Simultaneously the motorman turned his head
and gave a frightened shout:</p>

<p>“She’s got away from me! We’d all better
jump!”</p>

<p>The car was on a steep down grade. Its speed
was momentarily increasing, and it leaped and
swayed wildly as it dashed down the hill. The
motorman had hardly spoken before he made a
leap from the front platform. The two boys saw
his form sprawling on the road as he landed staggeringly.
He was followed by the conductor of
the car, who, more fortunate, managed to keep
his feet after his jump.</p>

<p>All this happened with the rapidity of a swiftly
moving motion picture film. The two boys found
themselves alone.</p>

<p>When they had left Boston for High Towers,
the suburban estate of Professor Chadwick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Jack’s famous father, the car had for some reason
been almost empty. The last passenger, with
the exception of themselves, had vacated it some
moments before the brakes had failed to work
and the vehicle had started on its mad career
down the steep hill.</p>

<p>In a flash the runaway car had passed the two
operatives who had deserted it in terror, and was
dashing forward faster than ever toward the
foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Jack and his chum started for the front platform.
Jack had a vague idea that perhaps he
could control the runaway car. Before them
they could see, at the foot of the hill, a sharp
curve of the tracks, and beyond the flashing
water of Bluewater Cove, a small but deep inlet.</p>

<p>All this they had but a minute to realize.
Hardly had the details of the scene impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
themselves on their minds—scarcely had Jack
grasped the brake handle and twisted it desperately,
before the car appeared to leap into the air
like a thing instinct with life. There was an
alarmed shout from both boys, which was
echoed by a gray-haired man, who rushed from
an odd-looking building, abutting on the water,
at the same instant that the car left the tracks at
the curve.</p>

<p>The lads had just time to glimpse his overalled
figure and to note his alarm, when everything
was blotted out as the car dashed into a
clump of trees and was utterly demolished.</p>

<p>It was an hour or so later when Jack and his
chum came back to their senses. Their eyes
opened on a scene so strange to them that they
were completely at a loss to account for their
surroundings. Jack lay on a sort of cot-bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
while his returning senses showed him Tom reclining
on a similar contrivance almost opposite
him.</p>

<p>The room in which they were was an unceiled,
unpapered apartment. The walls were of rough
pine wood, and above them the naked rafters
showed. In one corner was a stove, and in another
a well-furnished set of book shelves. A
library table which was littered with papers supported
a reading lamp as well as what appeared
to be models of different bits of machinery.
Taken as a whole, the room appeared to be a
section of a large wooden shed, paneled or partitioned
off to serve as a living place.</p>

<p>To Jack’s eyes, trained as they were to comprehend
the details of machinery, it was perfectly
plain that whoever occupied the place was
engaged on some difficult, or at least abstruse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
problems connected with a mechanical device; although,
of course, as to what the nature of this
might be, the lad could not hazard a guess.</p>

<p>“Where in the world are we, Tom?” he asked,
as he saw by Tom’s opened eyes—one of which
was badly blackened—that his cousin was in full
possession of his senses.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s a funny-looking place.
Say, Jack, are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No; that is, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>Jack stretched his limbs carefully. Apparently
the result of his self-inspection was satisfactory,
for the next moment he said:</p>

<p>“No; I’m sound as a new dollar. How about
you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“All right, except that my eye feels as if it was
as big as the State House dome. Jiminy, what
an almighty smash!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>“Yes; we were lucky to get out of it alive. But
where on earth are we? That’s what I want to
know.”</p>

<p>At this juncture a door at one end of the room
opened and the same figure that had rushed from
the waterside shed as the car left the curve appeared.
It was that of a kindly-faced man of
about sixty. His tall figure was bent and
stooped, but fire and energy still twinkled in a
pair of piercing black eyes. Although the possessor
of these attributes wore overalls, it was
evident that he was not a laboring man. His
face was rather that of a dreamer, of a man accustomed
to deal with mental problems. In one
hand he carried a pitcher of water, while in the
other he had a stout volume bound in yellow
calfskin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>
<p>“Ah! So my young patients are better already,”
he remarked as his glance rested on the
two wide-eyed lads. “You had a miraculous escape,”
he continued. “I saw you on the front
platform of the car as it left the rails and headed
for a clump of trees. I did not think that there
was a possible chance of your surviving, but it
appears that you did.”</p>

<p>He blinked his odd, dark eyes and smiled at
Jack, who was sitting up on his couch. His coat
and vest had been removed, and his head
throbbed rather wildly.</p>

<p>“What happened, sir?” he asked. “I remember
the car running away, and then I made for
the brakes—that was after the conductor and the
motorman jumped—but after that it’s all confused.”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” was the reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> “I dragged you
and this other lad out of a mass of débris. Had
it not been that a heavy beam protected you from
being crushed, you would have undoubtedly been
killed.”</p>

<p>“The car was smashed, then?”</p>

<p>“It is a complete wreck. The conductor and
the motorman were but slightly injured so that
you all came safely out of it by a miracle, as it
were.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know your name, but we are deeply
grateful to you for all that you have done for us,”
declared Jack. “My name is Chadwick, and this
is my cousin and chum, Tom Jesson.”</p>

<p>“Chadwick?” repeated the man, with the manner
of one who recalls a familiar name. “Are
you any relation of the famous Professor Chadwick,
the inventor?”</p>

<p>“I am his son,” rejoined Jack, not without a
ring of pride in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>“Then you must be one of the lads who went
through those extraordinary adventures in
connection with the wonderful vanishing gun
which you helped Mr. Pythias Peregrine perfect?”</p>

<p>“We are the same boys,” replied Jack smilingly,
“but so far as helping Mr. Peregrine was
concerned, I’m afraid we got him into more
trouble than anything else.”</p>

<p>“Not from what I have heard,” rejoined the
gray-haired man with conviction; “had it not
been for you the vanishing-gun device would have
been stolen, and possibly Mr. Peregrine’s life
sacrificed. But now, perhaps, it is time that I
made myself known to you. My name is Daniel
Dancer.”</p>

<p>“<i>The</i> Daniel Dancer?” exclaimed Jack, astonishment
appearing in his eyes. Tom’s round and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
rubicund countenance was alight with the same
eager surprise as they awaited the answer.</p>

<p>“I believe that I have been referred to as <i>The</i>
Daniel Dancer,” was the quiet rejoinder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> “You
appear to have heard of me before.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE “WHITE SHARK.”</small></h2>


<p>“Who hasn’t heard of Daniel Dancer?” cried
Tom enthusiastically. “Why, as dad used to say,
your name is almost a household word in the
field of invention.”</p>

<p>The gray-haired man regarded him quizzically.</p>

<p>“Possibly it is,” he rejoined, “but at the present
moment I am as much at sea regarding a mechanical
problem as any tyro.”</p>

<p>He nodded his head in the direction of the
model-bestrewn table.</p>

<p>“What I meant to make the crowning achievement
of my career, my diving torpedo boat, the
<i>White Shark</i>, is at present at a dead standstill.”</p>

<p>The two boys regarded him wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>“You mean that work on it is at a standstill?”
inquired Jack presently.</p>

<p>“Precisely so. I have to face certain mechanical
problems that have—I am free to admit it—fairly
stumped me.”</p>

<p>“You see,” he continued briefly, “the <i>White
Shark</i> is to be a combination diving and ‘skimming’
boat.”</p>

<p>The boys merely nodded and waited for Mr.
Dancer to continue. Plainly, developments of
possibly startling interest were at hand.</p>

<p>“But it is impossible for me to explain to you
just what the <i>White Shark</i> is, and what I hope
to accomplish with her, without affording you a
view of the craft,” resumed Mr. Dancer; “if
you feel strong enough I will show her to you.”</p>

<p>“But it seems to me that I read in a Boston
paper some time ago that your work here was of
the most secret sort,” said Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>“So far as the outside public is concerned such
is the case,” was the reply, “but to my fellow laborers
in the same field, as it were, I am glad to
be of service and to provide them with an interesting
sight; for I am vain enough to believe that
the <i>White Shark</i> is one of the most remarkable
craft in the world at the present time.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see it above all things,” cried
Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>“The same here,” responded Tom, with expectant
eyes, “I feel quite recovered from my
shaking up.”</p>

<p>“That is good. Now if you will get up and
follow me, I think I can show you something that
will surprise you.”</p>

<p>So saying the inventor crossed the room to another
door than the one by which he had entered.
The boys, following him, found themselves in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
big shed from which “ways” sloped down to the
water’s edge. An extended view of the ocean
was not possible, for two doors of stout construction
barred the gaze of any curious person who
might have tried to obtain a view of the <i>White
Shark</i> from the sea.</p>

<p>But for these details the boys had no eyes.
Their gaze was riveted on what, in outside appearance,
at any rate, fully justified its designer’s
appellation: “One of the most remarkable
craft in the world.”</p>

<p>The <i>White Shark</i> was secured at the top of the
ways, presumably ready to take a plunge into
the element for which she was designed. She
was about seventy feet in length, and shaped like
a rather stout barrel with pointed, conical ends.</p>

<p>At one end was a propeller of bronze, and at
the other a long tube, like a snout, or nose. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
puzzled the boys greatly, but for the time they
refrained from asking questions. The material
of which the <i>White Shark</i> was constructed was
a mystery also. It glistened like polished nickel
and was as smooth and bright as a mirror.</p>

<p>“The <i>White Shark</i> is built throughout of Monel
metal, a material that will not tarnish or corrode,
but always remains bright,” explained Mr.
Dancer.</p>

<p>Jack nodded his head.</p>

<p>“It’s something quite new, isn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s the invention of a friend of mine in
New Jersey. It is almost as light and far
stronger than aluminum.”</p>

<p>There was a ladder leaning against the side of
the odd craft and Mr. Dancer, beckoning to the
boys, signed them to follow him. He ascended
the rungs with remarkable agility for a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
his apparent age and reached the top of the cylindrical
craft long before the boys did.</p>

<p>The rounded top of the diving craft was as
smooth and bright as its sides. A low rail ran
round the “upper deck,” if such it could be called,
and at first sight it appeared that there was no
way of penetrating to the interior of the <i>White
Shark</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer bent, however, and pressed a button,
at first hardly discernible. A panel slid
back noiselessly, revealing the first steps of a
flight of steep stairs.</p>

<p>“One moment till I light your way,” said the
inventor, “I don’t want you to fall down stairs
and get into trouble twice in one day.”</p>

<p>He gave an odd, dry little laugh as he said this
and reaching within, he pressed another button.
There came a sharp click, and below them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
fascinated boys saw the interior of the unique
vessel illuminated by a soft white light of intense
radiance.</p>

<p>“I invite you on board the <i>White Shark</i>,” said
Mr. Dancer with a bow and a wave of his hand
toward the entrance; “you will be the first outsiders
to visit it.”</p>

<p>With hearts that beat a little faster than usual
at the idea of the novel experience before them
the two lads stepped within the opening and began
the descent of the stairs.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>A WONDERFUL CRAFT.</small></h2>


<p>At the foot of the stairs they found themselves
within a room, narrow and high ceiled by the
curved deck above, from each side of which three
doors opened. In the center, suspended from the
ceiling so as to be out of the way when not in
use, a table swung, which could be lowered when
wanted. Along the walls were folding chairs and
lounges of the same description. At one end
were bookshelves containing what appeared to be
scientific works. A soft carpet was on the floor
and the decorations of the chamber were handsome,
but plain and solid looking.</p>

<p>The light which flooded the place came from a
ground-glass dome in the ceiling. At the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the room opposite to that occupied by the bookshelves
was a table with glittering, metallic apparatus
on it. Jack and Tom instantly recognized
this as constituting an unusually complete
wireless outfit.</p>

<p>“Why, the <i>White Shark</i> surely is a wonderful
craft!” exclaimed Jack delightedly, gazing about
him.</p>

<p>Tom echoed his enthusiasm; but Mr. Dancer
merely said:</p>

<p>“Wait; I have more, much more, to show you.”</p>

<p>He opened one of the doors that led off the
main chamber which they had just been examining.
It disclosed a small cabin, furnished with
two Pullman bunks, one above the other.</p>

<p>“There are three cabins like this,” said Mr.
Dancer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> “Those other two doors open into a
bathroom and kitchen respectively. The last door
leads to my private cabin.”</p>

<p>In turn these rooms were shown. Mr. Dancer’s
cabin was similar to the others, but slightly
larger. A writing desk and some scientific instruments
were within it. The kitchen proved to be
a perfectly equipped “ship’s galley,” clean and
compact, and the bath room fixtures were of the
whitest porcelain, and included a fine shower
bath.</p>

<p>“Now for the engine room,” said Mr. Dancer,
when the boys had expressed their delight over
the features of the <i>White Shark</i> they had already
seen.</p>

<p>He opened a metal door in the after bulkhead
of the main cabin and ushered the partially bewildered
lads through it. The engine room of
the <i>White Shark</i> was an odd looking place. Instead
of pipes and valves, wires and switches
were everywhere. In the center of the metal floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
were two powerful electric motors, and at the
side of each was a dynamo which, Mr. Dancer
explained, connected with the storage batteries
in which electricity was stored for practically
every purpose on the diving craft.</p>

<p>“I light, cook, and drive my engines by electricity,”
explained their guide; “in fact, everything
on board is done by it. Even my steering
devices and aluminum diving apparatus is electrically
controlled. It is simple, takes up but
little room and is always efficient.”</p>

<p>“Those must be very powerful engines,” ventured
Tom, who had been examining them with
interest.</p>

<p>“They can develop more than 1500 horsepower
each,” was the reply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> “and weigh but very
little in comparison with their efficiency. They
will drive, or so I figure, the <i>White Shark</i> at
twenty-five miles an hour on the surface, and
might be made to develop thirty and even more
miles per hour if pushed hard.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t go so fast under water,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“No; the resistance is, of course, much greater,
but I hope to do twenty miles under the surface
of the sea.”</p>

<p>“That will be faster than any submarine has
ever gone?”</p>

<p>The question came from Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, much faster, but then, in constructing
the <i>White Shark</i>, I have got far away from the
ordinary types of diving craft.”</p>

<p>“What is that long snout at the bow for?”
asked Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>
<p>“That takes the place of a conning tower. It
is a sort of telescope through which I can look
out while running far under water. Near its end
are concealed two small, but very powerful,
searchlights that transform the perpetual darkness
under the water to almost the light of day.”</p>

<p>“But on the surface,” asked Jack, who had
seen submarines before at naval maneuvers,
“don’t you use a conning tower?”</p>

<p>“No; we spy out our surroundings by an improved
periscope, with the general principles of
which I suppose you are familiar.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s a tube that can be raised above the
surface and then reflects that surface upon a sort
of desk, where the operator of the craft can see
every detail plainly.”</p>

<p>“That describes it roughly. And now let us
visit the steering room and the torpedo chamber.
I also want to show you the submarine gun with
which the <i>White Shark</i> is fitted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>“This surely is a wonder ship,” gasped Tom;
“a submarine gun! I suppose we’ll be introduced
to a submarine lawn-mower next.”</p>

<p>Passing back through the main chamber, they
reached the bow. At the front end of the conical-shaped
room was what appeared to be the
mouth of a steel tube. This, the boys knew, was
the lookout tube. The inventor switched on the
lights and showed the wondering lads just how a
ray of light, powerful enough to pierce the
gloomy ocean depths, could be shot out from it.
He then exhibited to them the periscope device
and worked it for their benefit. By manipulating
a crank the long tube of the periscope rose from
the deck above, and upon the ground glass beneath
its lower end the boys soon made out the
details of the shed outside.</p>

<p>Behind the periscope attachment, and so situ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>ated
that it commanded a full view from the
lookout tube, was the steering apparatus. But
instead of the customary wheel all that appeared
was a row of buttons and a switch board of polished
wood.</p>

<p>The whole contrivance was not unlike the desk
of a telephone “central,” which most of you boys
must have seen. In fact, both Jack and Tom
thought it was a telephone switch board, and
said so.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer smiled.</p>

<p>“There is communication with all parts of the
boat from the steersman’s seat,” he said, “but it
is by speaking tubes. I also have an automatic
annunciator which signals the engine room if I
want to go fast, slow, or to back up.”</p>

<p>“I noticed it when we were in the machinery
section,” said Jack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> “You have the entire boat
under your control from here?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I could, in an emergency, stop the engines
from here. But what I am most anxious
to show you is my submarine gun and compressed-air
devices for sending torpedoes on their
deadly missions.”</p>

<p>He turned to what appeared to be a steel box
affixed in the bow portion of the craft alongside
the sighting tube. At one side of the box were
levers, and a chute led down to it from above.</p>

<p>“The torpedoes are stored overhead,” explained
the inventor;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> “when wanted this lever is pulled
and one slides down and enters this box. From
there it is launched by compressed air, which is
piped here from the engine room. In my type
of torpedo each missile carries its own miniature
engine, also propelled by compressed air. When
it leaves the side of the <i>White Shark</i> a catch
within that ‘launching box’ engages a projection
on the side of the torpedo which starts the miniature
engine in the latter.”</p>

<p>“And the submarine gun?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Right here. Doesn’t look much like a gun,
does it?”</p>

<p>He indicated a cylindrical object of blued, glistening
steel. To be sure, its “breech” was like
that of the accepted type of modern guns built
to handle high explosives, but its barrel was almost
square and apparently projected through
the skin of the <i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>This impression was confirmed by Mr. Dancer.</p>

<p>“The barrel of my gun, at least that part of it
which projects outside the submarine, is composed
of flexible rungs of metal, much as a high-pressure
hose is constructed; but, of course, it
is many times stronger.”</p>

<p>He went on to explain that this gun was cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>able
of propelling an explosive bullet half a mile
under water, and that it could be aimed in any
direction by means of a system of levers and
guiding ropes controlled from the interior of the
<i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>“But you cannot use gunpowder or dynamite
in the gun,” objected Jack, who, as we know,
under the tuition of Mr. Pythias Peregrine, had
become an expert on modern gunnery.</p>

<p>“No; but I have substituted another force;
what it is you will hardly guess. I flatter myself
that the idea is entirely original.”</p>

<p>“If it’s like everything else on this wonderful
craft it must be,” assented Jack warmly.</p>

<p>“The force that I use is nothing more nor less
than steam,” responded the inventor.</p>

<p>“Steam?” echoed Jack. “Why, how——”</p>

<p>“Wait and I’ll show you,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>Mr. Dancer bent over the breech of the odd-looking
gun and threw it open.</p>

<p>“I am going to show you the most remarkable
feature of the <i>White Shark</i>,” he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>MORE STRANGE DISCOVERIES.</small></h2>


<p>Within the breech of the gun was disclosed a
chamber enclosing a small cylinder of steel. This
was ribbed by metallic strips connected with electric
wires and capable of being superheated by
electrical current. Inside this chamber was
placed the explosive projectile which it was desired
to launch.</p>

<p>This done, a small amount of water was admitted
to the electrically connected chamber, and
a switch turned which caused the metal to become
superheated. In a flash steam, at terrific
pressure, was formed, and by a twist of a handle
it could be released when desired. Simple as the
device appeared, Mr. Dancer informed the boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
that in some experiments that he had made it had
proved most effective.</p>

<p>With the inspection of the gun their survey of
the craft practically was over, except for the exhibition
by Mr. Dancer of the anchoring device
and other minor details.</p>

<p>When they stood once more on the top of the
curved deck Jack exclaimed with enthusiasm:</p>

<p>“You have the finest craft of its kind I have
ever seen or read of, Mr. Dancer.”</p>

<p>But, far from seeming elated, the inventor
only sighed.</p>

<p>“It appears all right, I know,” he said, “and it
cost me almost all my fortune to build it; but
there is one fatal defect in it: the diving devices
do not work properly.”</p>

<p>The boys regarded the gray-haired scientist
with astonished eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>“It won’t dive?” asked Jack, at length.</p>

<p>“No; that is, not properly. You see, I had
devised a sort of double skin for it in parts, and
I imagined that I could fill this with water and
make the craft sink when I so desired, and then
pump out the water when I wished to rise.”</p>

<p>“And you did not do so?” queried Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, I equipped it with the tanks all right;
but I found that I would have to install such large
pumps that it would be impracticable to work
them with the power I had; so that now, as I
told you some time ago, you find me at a standstill.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you cannot think of any other
plan of making your craft ascend and descend in
the water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>“That’s just it. I’m up against a stone wall.
They call you the ‘Boy Inventors.’ I’ve heard
how you have aided other inventors in trouble.
Can you think of a way to make the <i>White Shark</i>
dive?”</p>

<p>“Not off-hand,” declared Jack positively; “but
I promise you we’ll give the matter thought and
do our best to help you. And now, Mr. Dancer,
we should be getting back. It is late and my
father, for whom we ran into town to purchase
some electric apparatus, will be worrying about
us.”</p>

<p>“But the wreck of the car has blocked the road
and I have no vehicle handy that you can use.”</p>

<p>“I thought I noticed a wireless apparatus on
the <i>White Shark</i>; is it working?” asked Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>
<p>“Yes; but its radius is limited. You see, I
had to install the aërials inside the hull of the
submarine; but with the powerful current I can
command I can send a message up to twenty
miles, or even more, under favorable conditions.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, then, I’ll send a message
to High Towers asking Jupe, that’s our colored
man, to come right over with the automobile.”</p>

<p>“What, you have a colored man who can take
wireless messages?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed, Jupe learned all of that on our
trip to the Gulf of Mexico.”</p>

<p>“True, I recall now reading about the colored
man in some magazine account of your adventures.
You must have had a stirring trip and
some exciting times.”</p>

<p>“We did, indeed,” was Jack’s reply.</p>

<p>Readers of “The Boy Inventors’ Wireless Triumph,”
the first volume of this series, will agree
with him. This story told of the finding of Tom’s
father, an explorer long lost in the mysterious
land of Yucatan, and also related the odd quest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
of Prof. Chadwick, including the astonishing adventures
of the two young inventors in a wonderful
craft of their own designing.</p>

<p>After returning from this exciting trip they
encountered, and aided materially, the inventor
of a vanishing gun, designed to fight airships.
Unscrupulous men tried to steal the plans of the
gun, and finally succeeded, but through the boys’
pluck and cleverness their purposes were ultimately
foiled. These experiences form a part of
the story entitled, “The Boy Inventors and the
Vanishing Gun.”</p>

<p>We now find them on the threshold of even
stranger adventures than have already befallen
them and, having made this necessary digression,
let us follow our enterprising lads once more
within the hull of the <i>White Shark</i>, the diving
craft that so far had not dived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Jack found the wireless of the usual type and
lost no time in sending out his call for High Towers.
After some delay, Jupe answered. Jack told
him to bring the small runabout to the place,
which he described, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The colored man agreed to be with them in
half an hour, and, much relieved, the boys sauntered
out of the shed with Mr. Dancer to await
the arrival of the auto.</p>

<p>They were standing in the road outside the
gates of the carefully secluded workshop, when a
man on a high-powered motorcycle suddenly appeared
from the direction of the grade down
which the runaway car had dashed.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer uttered an exclamation as he saw
him.</p>

<p>“It’s Adam Duke!” he exclaimed, in a rather
perturbed tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips before the
motorcycle chugged up to where the little group
was standing, and the rider swung himself from
his seat.</p>

<p>When he pushed up his goggles, after alighting,
the boys saw that the newcomer was a tall,
well-built man of middle age. But what might
have been a clever, good-looking face was marred
by an expression of fixed sullenness and aggression.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s all this?” he muttered rather
gruffly, as he stared at the two lads. As for Mr.
Dancer, even if his exclamation of recognition
had not told them, the boys would have known
that he was no stranger to the new arrival.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he exclaimed, as the
man motioned inquiringly toward the two boys.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>
<p>“A few words with you alone, Mr. Dancer.”</p>

<p>Then, as the inventor hesitated:</p>

<p>“Come; I’m in no mood to be trifled with.”</p>

<p>Under the tan that overspread his rather
wizened features the inventor turned pale.</p>

<p>“You must excuse me a minute,” he said, turning
to the boys.</p>

<p>Then he and the newcomer turned, the latter
having leaned his motorcycle against the fence,
and they entered the territory beyond the forbidding
palings that marked the dwelling place of
the <i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<small>A WILD CHASE.</small></h2>


<p>“That’s odd,” remarked Jack, as the two men
vanished.</p>

<p>“What’s odd?”</p>

<p>“Why, if ever I saw a man badly worried, it
was Mr. Dancer. What do you suppose is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“No idea. He’s in debt, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“No, that man didn’t look like a bill collector.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like his looks much, anyway. Wonder
who he can be?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s his name on a name plate on
that motorcycle,—Adam Duke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“That’s the name that Mr. Dancer used when
he came up. By the way, what do you think of
Mr. Dancer, Jack?”</p>

<p>“A fine type of man. He is rather dreamy
and impracticable, as only too many inventors
are apt to be.”</p>

<p>“He has some wonderful features embodied in
that submarine, though.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he has. But a submarine that won’t
dive isn’t much good.”</p>

<p>“No more use than a motor that won’t mote,”
coincided Tom with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Have you any ideas to help him out, Jack?”
he continued.</p>

<p>There was a far-away look in Jack’s eyes before
he replied. Then came his answer:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>
<p>“Yes, Tom, I have thought of something, but
whether it would be practicable or not I don’t
know yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve thought of anything, I’ll bet
you’ll manage to work it out some way,” quoth
Tom with admiring conviction.</p>

<p>“I wish that I could be as sure of that as
you, Tom,” was the rejoinder; “but hark! what’s
that?” he broke off suddenly. “It seems to me
that we can be of aid to Mr. Dancer right now,
Tom.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, yes! Listen, there it goes again!”</p>

<p>The sound both boys referred to was a sharp
cry for help coming from beyond the palings.</p>

<p>“Help!” shouted a voice that they had no difficulty
in recognizing as Dancer’s, and then again
came the cry for aid, sharp and thrilling in its
urgent need.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>“I’m right with you, Jack!”</p>

<p>Together the two boys dashed through the
gate which had been left open when Mr. Dancer
and the man they knew as Adam Duke entered
it.</p>

<p>Once inside they paused for an instant. Nobody
was in sight, but a cry issuing from a small
building told them that it was within that structure
that they were needed, and needed in a
hurry. Simultaneously both lads ran toward the
building, a small shed, apparently used as an
office.</p>

<p>As they neared it, a figure darted from the
door. It was Adam Duke.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” snarled Duke with an effort at
self-control; but his face was flushed and his eyes
wild; and then he shouted:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>
<p>“Take that, you young cub!”</p>

<p>A massive fist shot out, and Jack, taken utterly
unawares, was knocked from his feet into
the dust.</p>

<p>Before he could recover himself, Duke was
darting for the gate, but with Tom clinging to
him like a bulldog to a cat.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tom!” shouted Jack, gathering
himself together and regaining his feet.</p>

<p>He was about to follow Tom and the man
Duke when a moan from within the shed from
which Duke had darted arrested him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dancer or somebody is in pain or injured,”
he exclaimed. “My first duty is to him.”</p>

<p>Flinging a quick word of encouragement to
Tom, the boy ran into the shed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dancer! Mr. Dancer! Are you there?”
he cried as he entered the place which was in
semi-darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>“Who is it? Oh, who is it?” came in a moaning,
broken voice from some corner of the dark
shed.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack Chadwick! I’ve come to help you,”
rejoined Jack as his eyes, growing more accustomed
to the gloom, made out a figure huddled
in a half shapeless mass in one corner of the
place.</p>

<p>“I fear you are too late, my lad. The scoundrel
Duke has—has——”</p>

<p>“Yes?” urged Jack, bending over the recumbent
man.</p>

<p>But Mr. Dancer’s eyes closed and he sank back
unconscious. It was not till then that Jack felt
that his hands were wet, and realized that the
inventor was bleeding from a wound on the head,
apparently inflicted with some blunt instrument.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>
<p>“The man Duke has wounded, perhaps fatally
injured him!” was his thought as he hastily
sought for some means of staunching the blood,
which was flowing copiously.</p>

<p>A pitcher of water stood on the desk, and Jack
hastily soaked his handkerchief in it. Then,
returning to Mr. Dancer’s side, he bathed the
ugly wound.</p>

<p>Almost immediately he was rewarded by Mr.
Dancer opening his eyes and gazing at him in a
somewhat dazed way.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what has happened?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes; it was Duke struck me. He has a sort
of hold on me, a monetary one. I can’t explain
now, but he has stolen papers from that desk.”</p>

<p>“Important ones?”</p>

<p>“Yes; in a way they are important.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, I may be able to catch him yet!”
cried Jack, darting from the shed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">“LOOK!” CRIED TOM; “HE’S THROWING SOMETHING AWAY.”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>His quick ear had caught the sound of an approaching
auto, which he recognized as his own
from the noise of the exhaust.</p>

<p>Sure enough, as he reached the gate in the palings,
his red racing runabout, designed by himself
along new lines, was pulling up to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’s sake!” Jupe shouted as he pulled
up; “what’s all dis hyah bobbin’ an’ flummery?”</p>

<p>As the colored man shouted the words, making
up expressions in his own peculiar way when
his vocabulary failed him, Jack saw that Tom
was lying at the roadside while Duke was making
a jump for his motorcycle. He had just time
to take in all this when Tom scrambled to his
feet. At the same instant Duke sprang to the
seat of his motorcycle and was off like a flash.</p>

<p>“After him!” shouted Tom, running toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Jack and the red motor car. “Don’t let him escape!”</p>

<p>“Then you are not hurt, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No; but he managed to fling me off and I
hit the road with a pretty hard bump.”</p>

<p>“Good—I mean it’s good you weren’t hurt.
Start her up, Jupe; don’t let that fellow ahead
escape.”</p>

<p>Both boys leaped into the car, and as they
chugged off Tom asked Jack if he had heard
anything of the cause of the attack on Mr. Dancer.</p>

<p>“He said something about ‘papers’ when he
regained consciousness,” rejoined Jack, “but I
didn’t question him further.”</p>

<p>“Gollygumption, ef you boys ain’t allers in
some sort of conniption fits,” sputtered Jupe;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
“what’s de conflaggerationous matter now?”</p>

<p>“Just this, Jupe, that by chance we met Mr.
Dancer, an inventor. A short time after, he
was brutally attacked by that man ahead of us
on the motorcycle. The man also stole some papers.
We must catch him if possible.”</p>

<p>“We cotch him or bust up dis yar Red Raben!”
declared Jupe, using the odd name he had devised
for the small but speedy red runabout.</p>

<p>The car roared and swayed as Jupe “opened
it up.” It sprang forward with a jump like that
of a live thing.</p>

<p>The man on the motorcycle glanced back over
his shoulder. He saw that the fast little automobile
was overhauling him, and instantly speeded
up his machine.</p>

<p>It was a grim race and promised to be a long
one, for the motorcycle appeared to be a speedy
one, and Duke apparently intended to spare no
efforts to escape.</p>

<small>JACK MAKES A PROMISE.</small></h2>


<p>Both pursuers and pursued were hampered by
the rather steep up-grade. But it was not long
before they reached the summit, and then began
an even more hair-raising exhibition of speed
than before. The red auto appeared to rush
through the air, the fences and trees on either
side whizzed by in a blur, while the road unrolled
like a white ribbon as they burned up
space.</p>

<p>“Gracious, we’re going!” gasped Tom.</p>

<p>“So is that chap ahead,” rejoined Jack with
grim humor; “let her out some more, Jupe.”</p>

<p>“Golly to goodness, Marse Jack, ah daren’t,”
panted Jupe, the words coming out of his lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
between gasps. “De littlest bit mo’ ob dis an’
we am all busted to smithereens, fo’ sho’.”</p>

<p>“Well, do the best you can then.”</p>

<p>“We’s doin’ dat right now,” Jupe assured his
young employer.</p>

<p>For a few minutes more the chase continued
in stern silence. Fortunately, no vehicles or pedestrians
were encountered, as the road was a
more or less lonely one.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom gave a yell of triumph.</p>

<p>“Hurray! He’s slackening speed, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough he is. Something’s the matter
with his machine. Hit it up, Jupe.”</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Tom the next instant; “he’s
throwing something away.”</p>

<p>“So he is; a bundle of papers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>“They’re the ones he stole! I reckon he knows
we’d soon catch him if his machine broke down,
and he has thrown them away to cause us to
stop and pick them up. Are you going to?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they must be more important than capturing
the man. Slow up, Jupe, we’ll pick up
those papers.”</p>

<p>“I hate to lose the chance of catching that rascal.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we can catch up with him again,”
rejoined Jack.</p>

<p>The machine came to a stop and Jack jumped
out. A glance at the papers showed him that
they were covered with carefully drawn plans
and calculations. He readily guessed that they
must be the articles for which they were in
search.</p>

<p>“That came out finely,” he said as he revealed
the contents of the bundle to Tom;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> “we’ve recovered
Mr. Dancer’s work without half as much
trouble as I expected.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ve lost that man,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>He pointed ahead. Far down the road a dot
was rapidly disappearing in the distance. Somehow
the motorcycle had recovered its speed and
was now so far ahead that catching up to it
seemed impossible.</p>

<p>This being the case, there was nothing to be
done but to turn back and make with all haste
for the inventor’s plant. They reached it without
further event and found the inventor awaiting
them outside the palings. He had bound a
white cloth around his wound, which he declared
did not hurt him much.</p>

<p>“We have good news for you,” cried Jack,
waving the papers; “I guess we’ve recovered
what that rascal took.”</p>

<p>A brief examination showed Mr. Dancer that
the papers recaptured were the identical ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
taken from his desk. He explained that he had
once been associated in the machinery business
with Duke, but that the latter had proved dishonest
and that he had closed all negotiations
and dealings with him. Duke in revenge had
made one or two attacks on him before, and this
time had almost succeeded in injuring him seriously,
besides stealing the plans of the diving
torpedo boat.</p>

<p>“He must have known, however, that they
would be useless to him,” the inventor continued,
“for most of my ideas are patented and I used
a secret method of calculation of my own. Without
the key nobody could understand what was
on the papers.”</p>

<p>“And in any event the boat is not yet completed?”</p>

<p>“No,” sighed the inventor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> “I am afraid that
all my time and expense has gone for naught unless
some means of making the boat dive can be
found.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will promise to do all I can,” Jack
promised him; “I’ll lay the case before my father
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” was the rejoinder;
“there is nothing like putting a fresh young mind
to work on such problems. Often the very fact
that one has devised a thing makes one blind to
its defects and thus unable to remedy them.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall hit on a way of solving your
difficulties,” struck in Tom. “By the way, we
pass a police station on our way home; do you
wish us to ask them to send protection to you to-night?”</p>

<p>“No, I have no fear of Duke returning. But
if he should do so, I shall have my assistant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Silas Hardtack, with me to-night, and as he is
a former man-o’-war’s man and afraid of nothing,
I shall be well protected.”</p>

<p>“At least lock those papers in that iron safe
I noticed in your office,” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“I shall do so. Thank you for what you have
done. Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” hailed the boys, “we’ll see you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, and I hope you will bring with you
some solution of my difficulties.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE LAUNCHING OF THE MODEL.</small></h2>


<p>That night in the library of the Chadwick
home, two boys and a dignified looking man, who
wore a nut-brown beard slightly tinged with
gray, sat poring over a pile of books and papers,
their work illumined by a strong electric reading
lamp.</p>

<p>The eldest of the party was, of course, Mr.
Chester Chadwick, and the two lads, his son and
nephew. Tom’s father, Mr. Jesson, was absent
in the Northwest, making a collection of the flora
of the region.</p>

<p>“It is plain enough,” Mr. Chadwick was saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
“that your friend’s craft, owing to its construction,
cannot be equipped with the usual tanks
employed in submarine designing. What we
have to do, is to find out some other way of
forcing it beneath the surface and keeping it
there, if necessary.”</p>

<p>Jack, who had been busy with a sheet of paper
for the last twenty minutes, looked up.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve got an idea,” he said; “of course,
although it looks all right on paper, it might not
work out in practice.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see it, my boy,” said Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>The rough sketch that Jack had made showed
the <i>White Shark</i> equipped with peculiar looking
paddle-wheels of spiral design instead of the ordinary
type.</p>

<p>“My idea is,” he said modestly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> “that of the
Archimedian screw. When on the surface these
spirals could be set level, but a slight tilt would
drive the <i>White Shark</i> down toward the bed of
the sea. To rise, you would simply have to reverse
the process.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Your idea sounds by no means impossible of
being put into practice,” he said after a moment’s
consideration and a swift scrutiny of Jack’s
rough sketch.</p>

<p>“We would have to test it out with a model,
of course,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course. But the engines in the <i>White
Shark</i> are not so placed that they would drive
propellers of this character, for, you know, there
would be one on each side, on the principle of
paddles instead of stern propellers.”</p>

<p>“That was my idea,” said Jack;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> “but I think it
would be a simple matter to alter the position
of the motors and install all the necessary driving
shafts and gears.”</p>

<p>The subject was discussed till late and they
parted for the night determined to put Jack’s
idea to a test in the morning. There was much
apparatus of various character about the workshops
attached to High Towers, and they anticipated
that the work of constructing a rough
model would not take long. As readers of the
other volumes of this series know, High Towers
was a big estate embracing a lake and surrounded
by a high fence, insuring privacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick had grown rich from his many
inventions and could afford to indulge in the
luxuries of his science. But, in spite of the idea
of the young enthusiasts that it would not take
long to construct a model, it consumed more than
a week. The work of installing the Archimedian
screws, so that they would be worked properly,
was especially tedious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>But at last it was done. The complicated
model of the <i>White Shark</i> was very like its original,
only it was built on a scale of an inch and
a half to the foot. It was an odd looking thing,
with its two screw-like fins attached to the sides.
Inside it were electric motors, and Jack had devised
a system of controlling it from the shore
with electric wiring; for it had been previously
decided to test it in the lake at High Towers.
To sum up its appearance in a homely simile,
the <i>White Shark</i> looked like a cigar-shaped bottle
with corkscrews on each side.</p>

<p>It was an excited group that on the morning
of the test emerged from the workshop in which
the young inventors had wrought out their ideas.
Mr. Dancer was one of the group, for, during
the construction of the model, he had been a
constant visitor at High Towers and had dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>played
much interest in the work. He had almost
recovered from the cut on his head, which
proved to be only a flesh wound probably inflicted
with a blackjack. Nothing more had been
heard of Duke, although the police had been notified
and a hunt was on for the inventor’s assailant.</p>

<p>The united efforts of the party were required
to place the model on a hand truck preparatory
to wheeling it down to the lake, where a sort of
launching platform had been built. The eyes of
all were bright with anticipation, though, and
in the general excitement and enthusiasm there
was no complaint of the work, which was really
hard.</p>

<p>High Towers Lake was a body of water partly
artificial and partly natural. Thick brush grew
round its edges and it was indented by many
small bays or coves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>When they reached the water’s edge, they
found the electric apparatus which was to control
the diving model already in place and the
wires ready to be connected. This did not take
long, and then came a momentary pause before
the ceremony of launching.</p>

<p>“We ought to give it a name,” declared Jack
before he cut the cord which held the model in
place.</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Mr. Chadwick; “come,
Tom, think up one.”</p>

<p>“I have already thought of one,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“The <i>Mister T. Jesson</i>, I suppose,” scoffed
Jack.</p>

<p>“No, not that, nor the <i>J. Chadwick</i>, either,”
retorted Tom;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> “my name was <i>White Shark,
Jr.</i>”</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed,” said Mr. Chadwick with
a laugh, “the <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>, it shall be.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope it proves a good example to its
parent,” chimed in Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, the child is father to the man, as they
say in the copy books,” smiled Mr. Dancer, “so
let’s hope that the rule will work out in the case
of a submarine.”</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t we to christen it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“In what way?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“By breaking a bottle of wine over the bow,
of course.”</p>

<p>This came from Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, we have none of that sort of stuff here,”
said Mr. Chadwick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> “so I would propose that,
as the native element of the model is to be under
the water, we let her ‘christen’ herself as she
dives into it.”</p>

<p>All agreed that this was a good plan, and then
as everything was ready Jack drew his knife
across the cord. The little craft slid down the
ways just like what Tom called “a regular ship.”</p>

<p>It struck the water in a cloud of spray and
Mr. Chadwick shouted:</p>

<p>“I hereby christen thee <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Tom, furnishing the applause
proper on such occasions.</p>

<p>“Don’t holler till you see how it works,” remarked
Mr. Dancer, cautiously; “put on the power,
Jack.”</p>

<p>As the model submarine rose to the surface
after its dive, Jack pressed the button that started
the motors going. The spark flashed along
the wire and the tiny craft’s propellers flew
round with a whirring sound.</p>

<p>“Now for the real test,” said Mr. Dancer af<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>ter
a breathless pause, during which the <i>White
Shark, Jr.</i>, sped around in a circle, for Jack had
set the rudder so that the craft could not get
too far from shore.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed and at the same instant everyone
uttered an undignified yell of triumph. As
the concealed machinery tilted the screws downward,
the <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>, vanished from sight!
Five seconds later Jack brought the little craft
to the surface again, and then put it through a
series of diving and rising evolutions that showed
that his invention worked perfectly.</p>

<p>“If my dream is ever realized it will be solely
owing to you!” cried Mr. Dancer, glowing with
the fire of success and warmly clasping the boy
inventor’s hand.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>JUPE BATTLES WITH A WATER MONSTER.</small></h2>


<p>It was while congratulations were still being
showered on Jack,—for his father denied all
credit save for his occasional aid in the construction
of the model,—that a peculiar accident
occurred.</p>

<p>The wires controlling the machinery of the
diving torpedo boat were wound on reels, there
being about two hundred feet of wire to each
reel. This, of course, made it necessary to restrict
the <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>, to a limited radius
of operations. Suddenly, however, instead of
continuing to circle in an orderly way as the
model had been doing, it darted off straight
across the lake at lightning speed. Before Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
could do anything to stop it, it reached the limit
of the wires, snapped them like so much thread,
and was off like an arrow over the water.</p>

<p>It was just at this instant that Jupe pulled out
in a small rowboat used for fishing—for the lake
was kept stocked—from one of the small coves
already mentioned. He did not see the <i>White
Shark, Jr.</i>, dashing across the pond straight at
him. The party on shore yelled warnings; but
Jupe, who was slightly deaf, did not hear them.</p>

<p>Instead he kept right on rowing.</p>

<p>“Wow! Look out for fireworks in about two
seconds!” shouted Tom, who could not control
his merriment. The others had to laugh, too.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jupe—supremely unconscious
of the fate that was rushing down upon him at
express speed—stopped rowing from some impulse
and looked about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>“Gollyumptions!” they heard him yell as he
saw the model submarine racing straight at him,
“by de trumpet ob Jubel, what kin’ of a fish am
dat?”</p>

<p>“It’s a shark!” yelled Tom at the top of his
lungs, “the <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>”</p>

<p>“A shark! Fo’ de Lawd! Ah’s a gone coon!”
bellowed Jupe in real dismay.</p>

<p>“It’s a submarine!” yelled Tom in return, “get
out of its way!”</p>

<p>“It’s bin’ eatin’ beans and hay!” shouted Jupe,
“but it’s still hungry, Great Gumptions to Goodness!”</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>The runaway submarine model struck the rowboat
full in the side. Jupe, who had risen to
his feet, was knocked overboard in a flash by the
impact of the blow. But the <i>White Shark, Jr.</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
never stopped going. Shoving the boat before
it, it sped on toward the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Jupe came to the surface—fortunately he could
swim—and grasped the side of the boat. It was
the opposite side to the one the model diving
boat had struck, and Jupe could find no explanation
for the fact that his craft was moving.</p>

<p>“Clar’ ter goodness!” he yelled, “dat shark
mus’ be towin’ me to shore!”</p>

<p>But he clung on till he felt his feet touch
ground, and then, yelling for help at the top of
his voice, he dashed off into the bushes in an
effort to get as far from the shark-haunted lake
as possible. It was not until half an hour later
that he ventured back, hearing voices near where
he had come ashore.</p>

<p>They were those of Mr. Chadwick and his
companions. Although the model was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
wrecked in the bow, they could not find words
to blame Jupe, so elated were they over the unqualified
success the trial had proved. The model
was placed in the boat and rowed back to its
starting point.</p>

<p>“I can patch it up so that we can use it again,”
declared Jack as they carried it ashore and made
an examination.</p>

<p>“Marse Chadwick,” begged Jupe, “you gib me
a lil’ medicine for my insides. I declar’ I’se
plum scared inter a stomach-ache by dat dar
shark.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to give you a good scolding,
you rascal,” laughed Mr. Chadwick, “and
as for the sort of medicine you want, you won’t
get any from me.”</p>

<p>“Not jes’ a teeny drop, Marse Chadwick? Ah
sho’ does feel po’ful po’ly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>“Not a drop, Jupe. Now be off and catch
some fish for dinner.”</p>

<p>“And look out you don’t get run over by a
whale this time,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>“Gollygumption! An ole whale, de daddy uv
all de whalesses in de seas, couldn’ hev scared
me no wusser dan dat contraption,” declared
Jupe as he shuffled off.</p>

<p>It was something like a month after this incident
that a group stood in Mr. Dancer’s workshop
surveying the original <i>White Shark</i>. The
addition of the Archimedian screws on her sides
had materially altered her appearance, and made
her look more like some sort of fish than ever.
A long period of difficult and disheartening
work had been concluded but an hour before,
and now the finishing touches were complete.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>
<p>“My! my! Things hev changed since I sailed
on the old <i>Ohio</i>!” sighed Silas Hardtack, a
grizzled old veteran of the Seven Seas, as the
party which consisted of Jack, his father, Tom,
and Mr. Dancer, stood regarding their finished
work, in which all had had a share, “when I
went to sea we’d hev called such do-dads as thet
‘floating tea-kettles.’”</p>

<p>“And a few years from now, submarines and
fast cruisers driven by crude oil engines in place
of cumbrous machinery will be the backbone of
the navy,” prophesied Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>Old Silas has already been mentioned as Mr.
Dancer’s assistant and factotum. He had a great
habit of perpetually recalling the way things were
done when he “sailed on the old <i>Ohio</i>.” In fact,
if one believed all that he attributed to the craft
of his youth, there never was such another ship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>“Well, now that our work is done, I’m anxious
to try if the <i>White Shark, Sr.</i>, works as well as
her <i>Junior</i> type,” said Mr. Chadwick. “Are you
ready for a test, Dancer?”</p>

<p>“There are some last adjustments to the machinery
that I want the boys’ help on,” was the
response, “and then I think everything will be
in readiness for the supreme test.”</p>

<p>His face paled as he spoke and he clenched
and unclenched his hands nervously. A few
short hours would prove now if he had squandered
his fortune and his time or actually produced
the most efficient type of submarine known.</p>

<p>As for the boys, they were half crazy with excitement.
As they looked at the odd craft before
them, it was hard for them to realize that in it
they were, within a short time, to make a test
that might be of the most dangerous order.</p>

<p>For not one of the party had any assurance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
except their faith in their handiwork, that, once
submerged, the <i>White Shark</i> would rise again.
It was not a cheerful thought to dwell upon—this
suspicion that danger of the gravest sort,
a death at the bottom of the sea, might lie before
them.</p>

<p>But in the last hours of work on the machinery
all such thoughts were forgotten. Every bit
of machinery was gone over, lubricated, and
adjusted. The screws were worked from a
geared shaft, which ran across the ship and was
connected with the motors by powerful gearing.
Levers at the right and left of the engine room
controlled the pitch of the screws. In general
appearance the engine room was but little
changed, except in small details, from its condition
when we last saw it.</p>

<p>Then came the moment when everything was
declared ready down to the last detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>“The <i>White Shark</i> is now as perfect as human
hands can make her,” declared Mr. Dancer with—for
him—a rare touch of oratory.</p>

<p>At five-thirty in the evening, an hour when
the sun was declining to the horizon, for the
time was in early fall, the last of the party that
was to make the adventurous trip was on board.
The group gathered on the curved upper deck
consisted of the inventor himself, Mr. Chadwick,
Silas Hardtack, the two boys, and Jupe.</p>

<p>For an instant before the time came for the
final plunge, they stood in silence. Then each
went to the place assigned to him previously.
Jack and Tom went to the engine room and Mr.
Dancer to the steersman’s place, while Mr. Chadwick,
Silas, and Jupe remained on deck to attend
to the last details of the momentous start.</p>

<p>The great doors which barred the opening of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the construction shed had been opened, the
“ways” were greased to facilitate the <i>White
Shark’s</i> slide to the water, and the last ropes that
held the craft in place were wound round the
stern “bitts” on the after deck.</p>

<p>“Ready?” hailed Mr. Chadwick through the
open panel.</p>

<p>“Ready!” came back from the steersman’s
seat, booming through the mouth of the deck
speaking-tube, which opened just below the panel.</p>

<p>Jupe, his ebony arms bared, stood above the
retaining ropes, axe in hand. By his side stood
Silas Hardtack.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick’s hand dropped—the preconcerted
signal.</p>

<p>“Now, my hearty!” yelled Silas, slapping Jupe
on the back. The darky’s axe fell and the ropes
parted like pack thread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>For one molecule of time there ensued a breathless
pause. Then came a start and a trembling
throughout the structure of the wonderful diving
craft.</p>

<p>But this was only for the space of a breath.
The next instant the slide toward the water began.
At the same time, Silas reverently broke
out on a stern flagstaff the splendid emblem of
Old Glory.</p>

<p>“Whee, Jack, we’re off!” exclaimed Tom below
in the engine room, oil can in hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, off on an unknown voyage,” softly whispered
Jack, his hand on the starting lever, awaiting
with keen intensity the signal to start the
engines on which so much depended.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick’s watch told off just ten seconds
between the start of the <i>White Shark</i> and
the instant she struck the water in a cloud of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
foam. Holding on to the rail with both hands,
the party on deck barely escaped being hurled off
at the violence of the impact.</p>

<p>“Whoopee! She’s afloat!” bellowed Silas
Hardtack as soon as he caught his breath.</p>

<p>“Gollyumption, I hope she stays that way!”
responded Jupe, his eyes rolling in his ebony
countenance.</p>

<p>The sea was as calm as a mill pond. Far off
on the horizon lay the smoke of a steamer. But
except for that, the expanse of water before
them was as solitary as a desert.</p>

<p>All at once a tremor, a feeling of life ran
through the structure of the craft.</p>

<p>The novel propellers had begun their work.</p>

<p>Gracefully as a floating swan the <i>White Shark</i>
moved off on her maiden trip.</p>

<p>“So far without a hitch,” breathed Mr. Chad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>wick,
“but will she dive—and if she does, will
she come up again?” he added.</p>

<p>Possibly that was the question which each soul
on board the newly launched craft was asking
himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>OFF ON THE STRANGEST CRAFT ON RECORD.</small></h2>


<p>It was not long after the start, that word
was sent on deck by means of the speaking tube
located near the panel, that it was time to come
below. The flag was lowered and one by one
those who had lingered on the whale-like back
of the diving boat descended.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick was the last to enter the craft.
As he did so, he pressed the controlling button
and the panel slid into place with a metallic
clang. The interior of the <i>White Shark</i> was
filled with the buzz and hum of machinery, her
lights glowed brightly and the air was as sweet
and fresh as that of the outside world.</p>

<p>Considering the power of her engines and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
amount of machinery within the metal hull, there
was wonderfully little vibration. The craft
glided along almost as smoothly as a limited express.
But before long, as they left the quiet
waters of the little bay, the diving craft began
to pitch and roll to the motion of the Atlantic
swell.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick was standing beside the inventor
at the steering device, Jack and Tom, of
course, were in the engine room, while Silas and
Jupe were occupied in putting everything to
rights in the cook’s galley, this and the storeroom
forming Jupe’s department.</p>

<p>“Well, the time has come for the <i>White Shark</i>
to make her first dive,” announced Mr. Dancer
at length.</p>

<p>The inventor was keeping rigid control over
himself; but, despite his efforts to force a firm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
voice his lips quavered as he pronounced his decision.</p>

<p>“Very well. I think we are all ready, Dancer,”
responded Mr. Chadwick, who appeared as
cool as an icicle. In one hand he held his watch,
for it was the intention of the heads of this
unique experience to record in minute detail all
that occurred on the <i>White Shark’s</i> first voyage.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give the signal now, Chadwick.”</p>

<p>“Whenever you see fit,” was the response.</p>

<p>The inventor’s lean, nervous fingers flew to
the engine-room signaling appliance.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dive!</span>”</p>

<p>That was the word that flashed up before the
boys’ eager, waiting eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s come at last,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>As for Tom, he could say nothing. But his
heart seemed to be beating till it shook his frame.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
His face was pale under its wholesome tan. As
Jack’s hands sought the levers, Tom clutched
his comrade’s shoulder with a grip that almost
made Jack flinch.</p>

<p>“Steady, Tom, old boy,” warned Jack, noting
his comrade’s agitation.</p>

<p>“I-I’m all right, Jack, b-b-b-but it <i>is</i> kind of
creepy, you know, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I haven’t had time to think,”
Jack began, when he broke off with a cry.</p>

<p>“Tom—Tom, old boy, give us your hand!
She’s—she’s——”</p>

<p>“<i>Going down!</i>”</p>

<p>The words broke from Tom’s lips with a sort
of sigh.</p>

<p>Then came a shout from Jack.</p>

<p>“Hold fast, all!”</p>

<p>It was well that he gave the cry. That is, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
was well for Silas and Jupe. As for the rest,
they knew what to expect and had gripped fast
to some handhold.</p>

<p>Jack glanced at the engine room indicator.</p>

<p>The <i>White Shark</i> was being driven toward the
bottom of the sea at an angle of thirty-five degrees.
When it is considered that a grade of
twenty-five degrees is called steep, one can form
some appreciation of the position of things on
board.</p>

<p>From the galley came suddenly a yell of anguish
and a sound as of smashing crockery. In
the cabins, loose articles could be heard tumbling
about, while a deep voice boomed out:</p>

<p>“Shiver my timbers, but this beats heavy
weather on the old <i>Ohio</i>!”</p>

<p>Jupe’s voice rang out in anguish:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>
<p>“Gollyumption, dere goes dat buf’ly soup I
had fo’ suppah! Good land alive, de butter’s
done got mixed up wid de onions! Dar goes
anudder plate! Say, lemme off’n dis cantamperous
contraption ob a floating oil-stove!”</p>

<p>“Jupe’s in trouble,” grinned Jack, “how do
<i>you</i> like it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Um—um, well, I suppose it’s all right, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going down, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how about coming up? Hullo, Mr.
Dancer’s put her on an even keel. How deep are
we?”</p>

<p>Jack glanced at the depth indicator on the metal
wall above him.</p>

<p>“Seventy fathoms.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, four hundred and twenty feet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>“That’s right, but the <i>White Shark</i> is constructed
to bear at least ten times the amount
of pressure we are withstanding.”</p>

<p>“But if we ever went too deep?”</p>

<p>“We’d be crushed flat as a pancake.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” was Tom’s sole remark.</p>

<p>In the face of what Jack had just said, he
could think of nothing more suitable to reply
than this unsatisfactory exclamation!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>IN DIRE DANGER.</small></h2>


<p>“Cl-a-a-a-ng!”</p>

<p>The signal, twice repeated, crashed out from
the bronze gong under the engine room telegraph.</p>

<p>“What’s the order, Jack?”</p>

<p>Tom gazed anxiously at the young chief engineer
of the diving boat as he put the question.</p>

<p>“Rise!”</p>

<p>The two boys exchanged glances. This meant
that the instant had arrived that was to prove
the success or failure of the invention. Once
more Jack’s agile fingers busied themselves with
levers and wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>“You have set the propellers to a rising position?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom; a few seconds now will tell the
story.”</p>

<p>The <i>White Shark</i>, which had been forging
ahead on an even keel almost on the bed of the
ocean, continued to proceed in that manner for
a short time. Then, as the twin propellers affixed
to her sides “bit” into the water, she slowly
raised her bow toward the surface.</p>

<p>“Clang! clang!”</p>

<p>The gong resounded again. But this time it
was not an order recorded on the face of the
signaling dial that it indicated, but a summons
to the speaking tube.</p>

<p>Jack sprang toward the bell-shaped mouth of
the tube.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>“Hullo! Engine room?” came back the query.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Dancer,” breathed Jack over his
shoulder; and then—“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Congratulations. The <i>White Shark</i> is a success.”</p>

<p>“I knew it, sir; I felt it, that is. We’ve done
a wonderful thing.”</p>

<p>“You may well say that, Jack,” came another
voice, that of his father; “I’m proud of you, lad.
It was your skill that did it.”</p>

<p>“Father, I——” began Jack, when something
occurred that placed a check on his further
speech.</p>

<p>He had barely time to seize a handhold to keep
from being flung off his feet to the metal floor
of the engine room.</p>

<p>“What in the world?”</p>

<p>“Great jumping gollyumptions!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>“Shiver my mizzenmast!”</p>

<p>“We’ve struck something!”</p>

<p>The exclamations recorded above came in a
volley from Tom, Jupe, Silas, and Jack.</p>

<p>The progress of the diving craft had been suddenly
checked. Preceding the startling cessation
of motion there had come a grinding, rasping
shock that ran through the submarine’s structure
from stem to stern. The boys had only time to
exchange glances when there came a summons
from the signal gong.</p>

<p>“Back up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if we only knew what had happened!”
cried Tom, starting for the door that led, by way
of the main cabin, to the fore part of the craft.</p>

<p>In a flash Jack was after him, pausing only to
set the lever that was expected to carry out the
hastily signaled orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“Hold on, Tom!”</p>

<p>The words snapped out like so many pistol
shots.</p>

<p>“But, Jack, we may be damaged! Sinking!”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference; your place is here.
Stand by that lever.”</p>

<p>The crisp, incisive tones of his chum’s voice
brought Tom out of his panic in a jiffy.</p>

<p>“All right, Jack; which one?”</p>

<p>“That one to the port side. I’ll stand by this.”</p>

<p>With throbbing pulses and strained muscles
they waited nervously the next order. But none
came. The <i>White Shark</i> shook and quivered as
her engines reversed with every ounce of power
they possessed; but still she did not move.</p>

<p>Then came another order. This time through
the speaking tube:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> “Drop everything and come
forward.”</p>

<p>The power was shut off, and, followed by the
curious and beseeching glances of Silas and Jupe
respectively, the boys made their way through
the interior of the hull to the steersman’s section.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Chadwick and Mr. Dancer
anxiously peering out through the observation
tube.</p>

<p>“What is it? What’s happened?” demanded
Jack anxiously.</p>

<p>“Are we in any danger of sinking?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I think not. But we are in a bad fix,”
was Mr. Chadwick’s response; “look out through
the observation tube and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>The two boys pressed forward, taking the
places of their elders. The searchlights concealed
in the mouth of the tube were turned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
at full power. The bright rays pierced the black
subwaters of the Atlantic like a gleaming sword
of flame. But at first the two lads could see
nothing, just emerging as they had from the
bright light of the engine room.</p>

<p>But after a while their sight became clearer.
Before them, like some scene viewed by vivid
moonlight, they saw the depths of the sea. Fish
swam to and fro seemingly fascinated, like moths
about candles, by the brilliant rays of the searchlights.
Looking down they could make out rocks
with fantastic fronds of seaweed waving from
them.</p>

<p>And then suddenly something else loomed into
view—a long, writhy-looking black object right
across the bows of the <i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s a serpent! A big sea snake!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“I only wish it were,” sighed Mr. Dancer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> “but
it’s worse than that. It’s the anchor cable of
some large ship.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we cut through it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“No, I fear we are hopelessly tangled in it.
When you backed the boat she refused to leave
the cable.”</p>

<p>“How did we come to run into it?”</p>

<p>The question came from Tom.</p>

<p>“You may well ask that, my boy, in view of
the fact that the searchlights show up the ocean
for quite a distance.”</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” struck in Mr. Chadwick,
“an unavoidable accident.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Mr. Dancer, “you see, we
were coming along at a fine clip when suddenly
in front of me I saw an anchor flash downward.”</p>

<p>“Some big craft is at anchor above?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>“There must be. I had no time to avoid this
entanglement before the anchor was hard and
fast in the ocean bed.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get loose,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course, unless we wish to remain here below
till the craft above us up-anchors, which may
not be for days or may take place in an hour.”</p>

<p>In rejoinder to Mr. Dancer, Jack’s father said:</p>

<p>“That is too uncertain. By the way, Dancer,
how long will the air remain pure in the <i>White
Shark?</i>”</p>

<p>“For twenty-four hours. I have an emergency
oxygen device which increases that supply by
some five hours, but the quality of air would be
bad.”</p>

<p>“It does not seem any too good right now,”
said Jack, aside to Tom. Then he added:</p>

<p>“How are we caught, sir?” addressing his
query to Mr. Dancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>“I think that a projection on the observation
tube has become entangled in the rope.”</p>

<p>“In that case we are in a bad fix?”</p>

<p>“About as bad as it can be,” was the reply;
“there’s no way of getting out there and cutting
the obstruction loose, even if we had diving
dresses, which we haven’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer looked about him despairingly as
he spoke.</p>

<p>“Too bad that such an accident should have
marred our first trip,” he said with that placid
submission to circumstances which was characteristic
of him.</p>

<p>“The only thing to do is to think of some way
to release ourselves,” declared Mr. Chadwick energetically.</p>

<p>“Obviously; but what to do, my friend?”</p>

<p>The question was put bluntly and Mr. Chad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>wick
had no reply for it. Tom broke the silence
that followed.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve got a scheme,” he said.</p>

<p>They pressed about him eagerly while from
the main cabin came a loud wail.</p>

<p>“Golly ter gracious, ah knowed suthin’ lak
dis yar ’ud happen. De idea ob dis yar diving’
’bout lak fishes ain’t right. Now we’s all gone
coons.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” roared the voice of Silas Hardtack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
“I’ve been on the old <i>Ohio</i> in worse holes than
this ‘un, and I’ll bet my bottom dollar we’ll get
out of this some way. But if you’ve got to die,
‘cookie,’ die like men did on the old <i>Ohio</i>—without
a squeal or whimper.”</p>

<small>TOM’S PLAN FOR RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>The words of the old salt were an inspiration
to the anxious group in the steersman’s section
of the craft.</p>

<p>“What’s your plan, Tom?” asked Mr. Dancer,
bravely banishing all trace of alarm from his
voice.</p>

<p>“Just this. We’ll see if we can’t shoot ourselves
loose.”</p>

<p>“Shoot ourselves loose!”</p>

<p>The others looked at Tom Jesson as if he had
gone suddenly crazy. But he returned their
glances without a trace of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I said,” he repeated steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>In his voice there was a ring that compelled
respectful attention to his next words.</p>

<p>“We have a submarine gun?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Mr. Chadwick eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, now’s the time to use it.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Dancer’s turn to ask questions.</p>

<p>“To cut that rope.”</p>

<p>“Jove! Chadwick, the boy’s right!”</p>

<p>The inventor clapped Tom on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You take charge of this,” he said; “anyhow,
you know the details of the gun as well as I do
by this time.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying that my plan will be successful,
mind,” warned Tom.</p>

<p>“Carry it out on your own lines. I’ll depend
upon you absolutely.”</p>

<p>Thanks,” said Tom, half laughing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> “but I’ll
need help.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” agreed the inventor instantly.</p>

<p>“Whom do you wish to aid you?” inquired
Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Silas and Jupe,” was the reply; “Silas knows
the gun almost as well as I do. Jupe can carry
ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Silas! Jupe!”</p>

<p>The two summoned by Mr. Dancer appeared.
Silas’s weatherbeaten countenance betrayed no
signs of emotion. Jupe, on the other hand, evidenced
every variety of fear.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lub ob de Holy Poker, Marse Jack!”
he cried, “what kin’ ob new trubbel am dis?”</p>

<p>“Why, you are not scared, Jupe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“Not scared? Gorryme! Fust mah soup am
spilled, ah’m scal-dead, an’ ebberyting knocked
galley west, den ah heahs dat we am stuck at de
bottom ob de sea!”</p>

<p>Jupe threw his hands above his head.</p>

<p>“Lan’s sakes and Moses pipes!” he cried,
“what you tink ah am? Annuder Jonah at de
bottom ob de ullibguitous ocean, swallowed up
in de tummy ob a ombliferous whale?”</p>

<p>Even in their predicament they could not help
laughing at the old negro’s perturbation.</p>

<p>“Cheer up and get to work, Jupe, and stop
enriching the English language,” urged Mr.
Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Yep, ef he don’t stow that guff I’ll treat him
as we did landlubbers on the old <i>Ohio</i>,” growled
Silas, with a meaning look at the shaking Jupe.</p>

<p>“Ah don’t want nuffin’ lak dat; ’deed I don’t,
Marse Siltack,” he wailed; “wha’ you want me
to do, sah?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you, you fountain-pen-colored moke,
jes as soon as I get my sailing orders,” roared
Silas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>“That won’t be long,” declared Jack. “Fire
away, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I want some ammunition for the submarine
gun and then I want you to help me handle it,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, my hearty!” cried Silas. “I
used to was first mate back on the old <i>Ohio</i>—first
gunner’s mate, I mean. Ever hear the
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

   <div class="verse">Wet or dry; yo-ho!</div>
   <div class="verse">And we—— ’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That will do, Silas,” broke in Mr. Dancer,
“take Jupe and bring that ammunition at once.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” declared Silas in what he
would have called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> “man-o’-war fashion.”</p>

<p>“Come on, you black imp of Satan,” he concluded
to Jupe; “let’s get some pills fer that
gun.”</p>

<p>“Pills!” cried Jupe. “Fo’ de lan’s sake, Marse
Silas, sah! We got stuck on de bottom ob de
sea and you talks ‘bout givin’ de gun medicine!
I resigns mah commission as chief cook and
bottle washah ob dis yar packet jes’ as soon as
we gits asho’—ef we ebber do.”</p>

<p>“And if not?” Tom teased him.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, sah, den I ’signs it anyhow.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Silas and Jupe had
brought the ammunition for the submarine gun
from the steel-walled magazine in which it was
kept. Naturally, steam being the driving power
for the projectile, there was no powder necessary.
In fact, the explosive bullet used looked
much like the missile hurled from a four-inch,
quick-firing gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>It was highly polished, and at its extremity
had a sort of mushroom-shaped tip. This was
the “bow,” so to speak, of this submarine death
craft. It was made broad so that it was not
likely to miss anything at which it was aimed.
The idea of the projectile was that as soon as it
struck an object the mushroom-shaped tip drove
down on a mercurial cap, which exploded the
charge of high explosive when it detonated.</p>

<p>The gun was sighted through a small tube
with an illuminated “eye” at its extremity.
Through this tube it was possible to see outside
the metal walls of the diving boat, and to sight
the object to be aimed at in the glow cast from
the searchlights in the observation tube.</p>

<p>Many times during the weeks of work on the
<i>White Shark</i> Tom had experimented with the
gun, and now there was no hesitation in his man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>ner
as he placed an explosive shell within the
breech of the gun and closed it. This done he
sighted the weapon carefully and then, with compressed
lips and grim, determined manner he
pressed the lever that admitted the water to the
superheated chamber.</p>

<p>A small wheel was then turned which closed
the water chamber. When it had been thus
sealed, Tom’s next act was to press the button
which set the electric current to its work of turning
the water into superheated steam.</p>

<p>“One! two!” he counted, and then, with a
quick nod as of assurance that he would succeed,
he bent over the gun and suddenly twisted a small
handle.</p>

<p>There was not a sound, but every one standing
in the chamber knew that the gun had been
fired. It was almost uncanny, this idea of re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>leasing
a giant force without there being the
faintest sound to show that the projectile had
sped on its way through the water.</p>

<p>Following the discharge of the gun came a moment
of intense anxiety, and then a cry from
the inventor:</p>

<p>“Hurray! It’s succeeded!”</p>

<p>“Good shot, my boy!” cried Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>Peering through the observation tube, they
had seen the snake-like line of the rope part as
the projectile struck it and exploded, turning the
water all about into thick white obscurity. This
condition lasted only an instant after the explosion.
It then became clear that the <i>White Shark</i>
was once more free.</p>

<p>Jack and Tom scampered to the engine room
as soon as they saw that the dangling rope no
longer menaced the safety of the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>“Rise at full speed!” came the shouted order
from Mr. Dancer.</p>

<p>The motors whirred and the <i>White Shark</i> shot
toward the surface.</p>

<p>It was not till then that Jack said in a speculative
voice:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>
<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if there’ll be trouble when
that ship up above finds out we’ve cut her anchor
line.”</p>

<small>A BRITISH SKIPPER.</small></h2>


<p>Not more than five minutes after her propellers
had been set in the rising position the <i>White
Shark</i> emerged on the surface. As soon as she
reached it, power was shut down and the panel
slid back. Then all emerged on deck, where an
odd sight met their eyes.</p>

<p>Through the twilight gloom they made out
the form of a bluff-bowed, square-rigged ship.
Over her rail forward leaned the figures of several
sailors, while aft, a bearded man, whom they
easily guessed to be the captain, was regarding
the sudden appearance of the submarine with
amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>In a voice that proclaimed him a dyed-in-the-wool
Britisher, he hailed them:</p>

<p>“‘Oo in the bloomin’ world may you be?” cried
the astonished tar.</p>

<p>“Simply a party of experimenters,” rejoined
Mr. Chadwick. “As you see, this is a submarine.”</p>

<p>“Ho yuss,” came in a voice of intense sarcasm,
“h’and does yer call h’it h’experimentin’
ter carry away my bloomin’ anchor cable? I
comes to anchor here to wait for a pilot an’ you
h’ups and cuts my rope. ‘Oo’s goin’ ter pay fer
h’it? That’s what h’I want ter know.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can come to an amicable arrangement
on that,” declared Mr. Chadwick; “how
much do you want for it?”</p>

<p>“Ho! I don’t suppose you’ll mind jus’ forkin’
over a ’undred pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got another guess coming, my
friend,” was Mr. Chadwick’s rejoinder. “I happen
to know something about the cost of cables
myself. I’ll give you sixty dollars for that rope,
and even that’s too much.”</p>

<p>“‘Ow much is sixty dollars in your bloomin’
money?” inquired the skipper of the square rigger,
after he had turned to and ordered his crew
to lower another anchor.</p>

<p>“Twelve pounds,” rejoined Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“H’all right, I suppose I ‘ave to toik h’it; but
h’I never thought that Halbert Jenkins ’ud live
ter ’ave his bloomin’ cable cut by a submarine.
H’I suppose that the next thing that ’appens, my
royals ’ull be carried h’off by a h’airship.”</p>

<p>“A hair ship,” grinned Tom. “They must use
barber poles for masts on a craft of that kind.”</p>

<p>“H’I didn’t mean the ’air of the ’ead; h’I meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the h’air of the h’atmosphere,” responded Captain
Jenkins with dignity. “You bloomin’ h’American
kids h’are too fresh, by a jolly sight.”</p>

<p>“We get that from living in the fresh h’air,”
remarked Tom in a low voice to Jack who, like
the rest of the submarine’s crew, was on the
broad grin at the British skipper’s indignant explanation.</p>

<p>“If you young men will go below and start the
engines we’ll run alongside and pay for the damage
we’ve done,” said Mr. Chadwick. “We
don’t want to become entangled in any international
complications.”</p>

<p>As the boys dived below, followed by Mr.
Dancer, they heard the British captain confiding
to Mr. Chadwick that a “good spanking would
do them kids a lot of good.”</p>

<p>With her propellers moving at slow speed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
whale-like form of the submarine was ranged up
alongside the big, black bulk of the British ship.
Mr. Chadwick handed up a roll of bills to the
skipper of the old craft and expressed his regret
over the accident.</p>

<p>“H’ih, that’s all right,” grinned the seaman
with airy good nature as he counted the money
with a wetted thumb, “h’it h’aint h’everybody
wot gets bumped by a submarine, guv’ner. It’ll
be a rare yarn ter tell the moites when h’I gets
back to h’old h’England.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the submarine was put at
full speed and headed for the shore. The return
voyage was made without incident and soon after
darkness had fallen, the odd craft lay once more
at her moorings just outside the construction
shed.</p>

<p>To reach the shore they tumbled into a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
boat that had been left at the moorings, and with
long, strong strokes Silas wielded the oars. As
the bow of the boat grazed the piles of the landing
place, Mr. Chadwick, his face glowing, turned
to the inventor.</p>

<p>“Dancer, let me congratulate you on a brilliant
success.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the boys here have contributed as
much to it as I have,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>“I wish we could get a chance to take a really
long cruise on the <i>White Shark</i>,” sighed Jack,
hurrying on to prevent more compliments from
the grateful inventor.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall have an opportunity,” rejoined
Mr. Dancer, little imagining that in the
near future his words were to prove prophetic.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>AN IMPORTANT TELEGRAM.</small></h2>


<p>“Hyah’s a telegram fo’ you, sah. De boy says
no answer.”</p>

<p>Jupe handed Mr. Chadwick the yellow missive
just at the conclusion of breakfast at High Towers,
the morning after the trial trip of the <i>White
Shark</i>.</p>

<p>The boys watched curiously as he opened the
envelope. Telegrams were no uncommon things
at High Towers. Anxious manufacturers and
inventors in quandaries of various kinds were in
the habit of summoning Mr. Chadwick, post
haste, to solve their mechanical problems.</p>

<p>But in the present instance Jack felt a conviction
that this telegram was of unusual import.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
His conviction became a certainty a minute later
when Mr. Chadwick uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said, turning to his son, “I want you
to look up the next ship sailing for Cuba. You
will find a list in the shipping column of the
morning papers.”</p>

<p>“All right, dad. Come on, Tom,” said Jack,
rising from the table and hurrying to the library.</p>

<p>“What’s in the wind now?” he said excitedly,
as they sped along a passage.</p>

<p>“You mean about Cuba?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Wonder why the governor wants
to know about a vessel for that island.”</p>

<p>“He wants to go there, I suppose,” rejoined
the practical Tom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>
<p>“I don’t see what could take him there, except
that iron mining property he bought recently, not
far from Santiago.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it is, it’s something urgent.
I saw his color change when he read that wire,
and anyway, a telegram always means a rush order
somewhere.”</p>

<p>By this time they were in the library, and turning
to the shipping columns of the papers.</p>

<p>“Nothing for Cuba for a week,” declared Jack
after a prolonged scrutiny of the sailing list.
“Well, that settles—— Whew! Tom, maybe this
sheds some light on the subject.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a glaring headline on the opposite
page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“AMERICANS IN DANGER IN CUBA.
REVOLUTION IN SONORA PROVINCE.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“‘Sonora Province,’ why that’s where dad’s
mine is located,” rushed on Jack breathlessly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
“Depend upon it, that’s what’s up.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! Don’t I wish we could go there!”
breathed Tom as they sped back to the dining
room.</p>

<p>“Nothing sailing for Cuba for a week, dad,”
Jack announced. “Did you see about the trouble
in Sonora Province?” he went on with an artless
glance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick laughed.</p>

<p>“I knew you were dying to know what was in
this telegram,” he said, “and you have certainly
adopted a clever way of eliciting that information.
I suppose you read of the revolution in the
papers?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“They say that property down there is in danger,—lives,
too.”</p>

<p>“You might have placed the lives first, my boy.
But apparently the papers are right. Here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the source of my information. Read it out
aloud.”</p>

<p>He handed the telegram to Jack, who took it
and read for his cousin’s benefit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Revolution started here. Rebels strong. No
troops at hand. The mine in risky position.
Come at once if possible. Native helpers and
workmen fled.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Jameson.</span>”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Jameson is my superintendent at the mine,”
explained Mr. Chadwick. “We have been experimenting
with a new method of smelting the
ore on the spot. Hitherto all Cuban ore has had
to be shipped to this country for refinement. We
save by using my processes and doing it at the
mine.”</p>

<p>“And all that machinery is installed there?”
asked Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>
<p>“Yes; it is worth considerable, too. Of course
Jameson may be exaggerating the danger, but as
he is a long-headed sort of Scotchman, I hardly
think so. I ought to be there as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“How long does it take to get there?” inquired
Jack.</p>

<p>“Five days from New York. There are no
fast craft running on that line. Twelve knots
is about the best they can do.”</p>

<p>“Then, with no steamer sailing for a week, it
would be almost a fortnight before you could
get there?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the <i>Sea King</i> is being refitted with
new boilers.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sea King</i> was Mr. Chadwick’s yacht. She
has already figured in one portion of the boys’
adventures, namely, those related in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> “The Boy
Inventors’ Wireless Triumph.”</p>

<p>“Too bad; the <i>Sea King</i> would have made the
trip in no time. Isn’t there some other way?”</p>

<p>“I might charter a yacht; but it is a long job
sometimes to find one that suits and is ready to
start at once.”</p>

<p>“A small craft wouldn’t do?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No. It’s coming on to the hurricane season
down in those waters. In case of bad weather
no small craft could ride such seas.”</p>

<p>Jack had been knitting his brow. Suddenly
his expression cleared.</p>

<p>“No small craft could ride them,” he echoed;
“but,” and he threw deep emphasis into his voice,
“I know of a small craft that could weather any
sort of hurricane.”</p>

<p>“I confess I don’t understand you, my boy,”
rejoined his father, knitting his brows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>
<p>“The sort of vessel I’m thinking of wouldn’t
stay on top at all,” replied Jack; “it would sink
to a safe depth out of the hurly-burly, so to speak,
and stay there till the storm blew over.”</p>

<p>“You mean the <i>White Shark</i>?” asked his father.
“Jove! that is an idea.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure that you’d think it a practicable
one,” rejoined Jack, “but I don’t see why it
shouldn’t be entirely feasible.”</p>

<p>“This looks like the trip we were talking about
last night, the one Mr. Dancer said he’d like to
take.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he would charter the <i>White Shark</i>
for such a voyage,” said Mr. Chadwick thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he would,” rushed on Jack eagerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
“I know he hasn’t got much money. The building
of the <i>White Shark</i> has made him a poor
man.”</p>

<p>“I could offer him a good figure. Such a voyage
would be worth it,” continued Mr. Chadwick.
“Besides, I would like to help out a brother
inventor in difficulties.”</p>

<p>The latter part of this speech was characteristic
of Mr. Chadwick. Unknown even to his
closest friends, his hand was often in his pocket
for needy investigators in the field of science.
Although the public does not know it, it was his
liberality in this regard that gave to the world
the Chalmers Patent Steel Refining Process, the
Walworth Tubular Boiler and half a dozen other
almost epoch-making inventions.</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” cried Jack, “we’ll take the car
and spin over and see him about it.”</p>

<p>Tom skipped about, hardly able to contain his
joy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>
<p>“A trip to Cuba under the sea, and revolutionists
and—and, oh, everything that’s jolly.”</p>

<p>“Nothing very jolly about a revolution,” rejoined
Mr. Chadwick, somewhat grimly, “they’re
no fun, I can tell you. But, seriously speaking, I
think your suggestion a good one, Jack. We
could live on board the <i>White Shark</i> in case of
serious fighting ashore, and such a craft would
afford a far swifter means of reaching Cuba
than any steamer.”</p>

<p>It was half an hour later that two excited boys
and a graver, more thoughtful senior, were discussing
the proposal with Mr. Dancer. Mr.
Chadwick’s liberal offer for the use of the <i>White
Shark</i> for his proposed trip had almost literally
taken Mr. Dancer off his feet.</p>

<p>“I hardly know how to thank you, Chadwick.
It’s a great chance, a great chance,” he exclaimed,
“but it is too much, really——”</p>

<p>“I shall feel offended if you won’t consent to
take us,” put in Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>“That’s not the difficulty,” said Mr. Dancer
quickly. “I want to make the voyage. It will
give the <i>White Shark</i> a testing out that will try
her every rivet. But there may be danger. Your
young folks here——”</p>

<p>Jack and Tom exchanged anxious glances.
Perhaps, after all, the plans that had looked so
rosy were to fall through.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt after what I have
seen of her that the <i>White Shark</i> can survive any
test that may be placed upon her. The fact that
I am willing to take my lads along should prove
my faith in your craft.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Chadwick,” said the inventor
with grateful eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> “then the last objection on
my part is removed. But when I have sold my
craft to some government—I hope to Uncle
Sam’s—I must repay you——”</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick waved his hand as if brushing
aside the idea.</p>

<p>“You have repaid me far more than I can ever
give you by affording me such an opportunity,
Dancer,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>“So then it’s all settled,” cried Tom with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>Moved by a common impulse the boys, glowing
with excitement, clasped hands and a wild
war dance took place.</p>

<p>As they paused, out of breath from their exertions,
Mr. Chadwick, in business-like tones,
asked:</p>

<p>“When can you be ready to sail?”</p>

<p>“By midnight,” said the inventor after a rapid
mental calculation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>
<p>“Then you boys had better stop capering about
and get busy on making a list of all we shall
need. Then you can go to town to purchase the
necessary articles.”</p>

<p>“Will we get busy?” cried Jack, sitting down
at the desk and drawing up a sheet of paper and
poising a pen above it:</p>

<p>“First article, please.”</p>

<p>After that the provisioning and stocking of the
<i>White Shark</i> for what was to prove a long and
adventurous period, went forward rapidly.
After lunch the boys in their red runabout set out
for Camwell, a suburb of Boston, where they
were sure to be able to purchase everything
necessary.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE VOICE IN THE DARK.</small></h2>


<p>“Hush a minute, Tom! What was that?”</p>

<p>Jack, who was driving the little red flyer,
brought the car and Tom’s tongue to a simultaneous
halt.</p>

<p>It was after dark and the two lads were returning
from Camwell with the car loaded down
with what they had purchased. In fact, both of
them were perched on the summit of a pile of
boxes and bundles, every available nook and
cranny being filled with articles for which their
lists had called.</p>

<p>The spot where the car was brought to such
an abrupt halt by Jack was a lonely one. On one
side of the road, thick brush with tall, melan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>choly
trees beyond, grew close down to the right
of way. On the other, the outlines of a fair-sized
barn bulked up black against the surrounding
darkness, for the night was starless.</p>

<p>The two lads had set out from Camwell an
hour before. Purchasing such a lengthy list of
articles as their orders called for had proved no
light task. To their annoyance, too, the magnitude
of their purchases and the way in which
they hastened from store to store, had caused
quite a stir in Camwell, a small manufacturing
place mainly devoted to the production of steel
and similar industries.</p>

<p>In fact, at six o’clock, the hour at which the
factories suspended the work of the “day shift,”
a small crowd had followed them from one place
of business to another. The bolder ones in the
crowd had even made inquiries as to their busi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>ness.
The boys had, of course, answered evasively,
and flattered themselves that no one in
Camwell was aware of their identity. They were
careful in the extreme to avoid any reference to
the object of their purchasing expedition—or
foraging raid, it might almost be called. But,
nevertheless, both had been glad when their car
chugged merrily out of Camwell, leaving behind
a residue of rumor concerning the descent on
that uneventful town of “the millionaire kids.”</p>

<p>As the car came to a halt at the roadside, both
boys listened intently. At first there was no
repetition of the sound that had caused Jack’s
exclamation.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it came again, a weird sort of
moan.</p>

<p>“Sounds like some one in pain,” ventured Tom.</p>

<p>“It does,” agreed Jack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> “perhaps some one has
been struck by a car; or——”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly as a figure sprang from
the dark bushes at the side of the road opposite
the barn.</p>

<p>“Hullo, who’s that?” hailed Jack.</p>

<p>“Hullo, yourself,” came back a rough voice in
reply; “who are you?”</p>

<p>“Two boys in a big hurry. What’s the trouble
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we thought we heard a moan,” came
from Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve stopped. I’ve got my friend
back in the brush there. We was walking from
Camwell to Boston when a car struck him. I
guess he’s badly hurt.”</p>

<p>The man’s voice appeared to hold genuine regret.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble with him?” asked Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>
<p>“Dunno. I ain’t got enough education fer that,
boss. He jes’ lies there an’ groans.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we heard,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s what you heard,” repeated the man in
the road.</p>

<p>Then he went on in an odd, hesitating voice, as
if hardly daring to ask a favor from the two
well-dressed young automobilists.</p>

<p>“Say, guv’ners both, would you mind takin’ a
look at him? Then maybe if he’s badly cracked
you could git a doctor with that benzine buggy
of yourn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about surgery,” confessed
Jack; “but we’ll help you out if we can. At any
rate, we can carry him to the machine and take
him to the doctor’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, mate. You’re a good feller,
I kin see that.”</p>

<p>Somehow the whining, fawning tones of the
man’s voice annoyed Jack; but nevertheless he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
was not the kind of lad to pass by any one who
was injured or in distress. So he asked Tom to
detach one of the oil lamps and prepared to make
an investigation.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Jack when Tom had the
lantern off and ready for use. It cast a good,
strong light, and as its rays fell on the countenance
and general outline of the man who had
summoned their aid, Jack was impressed still
more unfavorably than he had been by the fellow’s
voice.</p>

<p>He was a short, thick-set, roughly dressed individual,
with a crop of unshaven beard on his
chin that stood out like the bristles on an old
toothbrush. On his head was a battered cap.
His eyes were small and blinky, and as evasive
as a rat’s.</p>

<p>“Poor Jim is right back in there, guv’ner,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
declared in answer to Jack’s question, motioning
toward the bushes. “I carried him there after
he got hit,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you leave him on the roadside?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>Somehow, for some reason he could not
explain, he was suspicious of this man with
the bristly chin and the blinky, red-rimmed
eyes.</p>

<p>But the fellow answered glibly enough, momentarily
disarming the boy’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“You see, poor Jim’s head was cut. I thought
there might be water back there, so’s I could ‘a’
bathed it a bit,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Right this way, guv’ner,” he went on, pushing
his way into the brush. “Hark! That’s poor
Jim now!”</p>

<p>As if his voice was meant to guide them, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
injured man at this instant gave a heartrending
groan. If Jack had felt any hesitation in following
the rough-looking customer who had apprised
them of the accident, all doubt left him
now. The man who uttered that moan must be
badly hurt.</p>

<p>The blinky-eyed man reached a small opening
in the brush. Tom flashed the rays of the detached
oil lantern hither and yon against the
background of closely growing bushes and scrub
timber.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to see any one,” he was beginning,
when Jack detected a sudden footstep behind
him.</p>

<p>“There he is, guv’ner, poor old Jim, right
there,” urged Blinky, pointing in the direction
opposite that from which Jack had heard the
footfall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>Tom pressed forward; but Jack, prompted by
some impulse he could not explain, disregarded
Blinky’s instructions and turned about. It was
well for him that he did so. As he turned his
head a dark figure bounded toward him from
behind.</p>

<p>Jack felt a club, or some other weapon,
“swis-s-s-s-s-h!” by his ear.</p>

<p>A fierce growl broke from the man as his blow
missed. Before he could poise the implement for
another, Jack had closed with him.</p>

<p>At the same instant, from beyond, came another
voice. Even in Jack’s predicament he realized
that this new tone held something familiar.
But he had little time to think of that.</p>

<p>“Blinky! Duggan! Have you got ’em?”
hailed the new voice.</p>

<p>“Not yet, but in a jiffy,” came from Jack’s as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>sailant
as he wrested himself free of Jack’s grip
and, with a roar like a wild bull, intended to
frighten the lad, launched his bulky form full at
the boy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>THE MAN BEHIND THE MYSTERY.</small></h2>


<p>With doubled up fists, firmly planted in a scientific
attitude of defence, Jack awaited the onslaught.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you a lesson!” bellowed his assailant.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing, but stood his ground firmly.
However burly his opponent was, he had never
been taught even the rudiments of what has been
called the “noble art” of self-defense.</p>

<p>His tactics were those of a wild bull. He
swung his arms wildly, and even in the darkness
Jack could see the gleam of his clenched teeth.
All this the boy rightly judged to be, like the yells
which had been directed at him, part of a plan to
frighten him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>But while Jack was alarmed, it is true, he was
not so easily scared as all that. At school he had
been one of the best fellows in the “gym” with
the gloves. His muscles, what with right living
and lots of exercise, were like so many bundles
of steel cords under his healthy skin.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the road agent, or highwayman,
for Jack felt that he could be nothing else,
was big, but flabby. As again and again Jack
met his onrushes with swift and skillful side steps
and ducks, he generally managed, too, to leave
some memento of his athletic skill on one portion
or another of his opponent’s anatomy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, what of Tom?</p>

<p>Like Jack, he was no unskilled novice in the
art which Jack was practicing with such good
effect. Like his cousin, too, he had no lack of
courage; but it must be confessed that as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
heard Jack’s shout of warning and realized that
they had been trapped for no good purpose, his
heart gave a frightened bound.</p>

<p>But he had no time in which to dwell on his
sensations. As the voice which had struck Jack
as familiar boomed out, Blinky made a rush at
Tom not unlike the other rogue’s onslaught. But
Blinky was more skillful with his fists than his
companion.</p>

<p>Tom speedily found that it was all he could
do to defend himself, strive as he might with
every ounce of trained strength in him. He defended
his face to good purpose against a tornado-like
rain of blows. Blinky could not beat
down his guard there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all about his body the rascal’s
fists played like lightning. Tom pluckily defended
himself, his grit rising as the odds against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
him grew more desperate. But at last, in warding
off a heavy blow aimed at his ribs, he, for an
instant, relaxed his guard on his face.</p>

<p>Instantly, with the snake-like swiftness of a
fencer’s foil, Blinky’s burly arm shot forward.
But if it had the swiftness and precision of a
sword, it had also the force of a battering ram.
Tom was lifted right off his feet and fell blunderingly
into a patch of brush. It was lucky for
him that the tangle of bushes broke his fall, saving
his head from coming in contact with the
ground.</p>

<p>“He’s safe for a while,” muttered Blinky, examining
poor Tom’s white face and closed eyes
by the light of the lantern which had been
knocked over but not extinguished.</p>

<p>“Hey, Blinky! Gimme a hand here! This
kid’s too much for me,” came from the rasca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>l’s
companion, who was busily engaged now, not in
attack, but in defending himself.</p>

<p>The owner of the voice which had urged
Blinky and his companion on, was not in evidence.
Perhaps he thought discretion the better
part of valor, and kept himself carefully out of
the fray. However that may have been, he was
not to be seen.</p>

<p>At his companion’s appeal for aid, Blinky, with
a haste worthy of a better cause, hurried to his
side.</p>

<p>“Rush him!” he cried.</p>

<p>Together they charged on Jack like the forward
rush of a football team sweeping across
the gridiron.</p>

<p>“It’s all off now,” flashed through Jack’s mind.</p>

<p>There was not time to turn and run, not a second
in which to think up a line of defence. Besides,
had Jack been able to run, he certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
would not have fled and left Tom’s fate in uncertainty.</p>

<p>It was all over in an instant, and it could have
had no other conclusion. Jack found himself lying
on his back one minute and the next he was
turned on his face and his hands tied behind him.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of all this?” he managed
to gasp out indignantly. “I am Jack Chadwick.
You fellows are going to get in a lot of trouble
over this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not. Master Chadwick,” came a
low, sneering voice not far from Jack’s ear, “I
guess not.”</p>

<p>It was the familiar voice that Jack knew he had
heard before. But where? For the life of him
he could not imagine. Nor indeed was his mind
in a condition right then to be at its clearest.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded the boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> “What
have you attacked us for?”</p>

<p>“Partly to get even for a certain occasion in
which you interfered with my plans, and partly
to trouble you for that money you have in your
shoes.”</p>

<p>As a flash of lightning illumines a whole landscape,
so did the first words of the other instantly
recall to Jack why his voice had sounded
so puzzlingly reminiscent. “A certain occasion
on which you interfered with my plans!”</p>

<p>“You’re Adam Duke!” he gasped out.</p>

<p>“Confound you! So you recognize my voice,
do you? I didn’t mean you to. But, after all, it
doesn’t much matter. By the time you rejoin
your friends again I’ll be far away. Take his
shoes off, Blinky.”</p>

<p>Jack flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>“What for?” he asked angrily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> “What do you
expect to find?”</p>

<p>“About five hundred dollars, and a similar sum
in your friend’s shoes.”</p>

<p>Jack’s heart sank. How Duke had obtained
his information he could not imagine, but it was
true. He and Tom had decided to draw that sum
each from their substantial deposits in the Camwell
bank. Fearful of carrying such a large sum
in bills of big denomination on their persons in
ordinary fashion, they had decided to conceal
them in their shoes.</p>

<p>It was not hard to hide the five one hundred
dollar bills, placing three in one shoe and two in
the other.</p>

<p>How could the man Duke have guessed where
they carried their valuables, and how came he to
know the route that they would take home—not
the usual one between Camwell and their destination?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>ADAM DUKE’S METHODS.</small></h2>


<p>As if Duke had guessed the boy’s thoughts,
he broke into a harsh laugh. Had it been light,
the boy would have been able to see the yellow,
puckered skin about the man’s nervous jowls
quiver with merriment.</p>

<p>“I don’t forget easily,” he chuckled, “and when
I saw you in Camwell, everything came back to
me. I’m telling you all this so that any time you
feel inclined to get into trouble with me again
you’ll think twice.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Jack, face downward in
the dusty patch of cleared ground among the rank
growth of weeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>“You don’t recall seeing me at the bank, I
guess?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do not. I should otherwise have
been on guard against you,” was the indignant
reply.</p>

<p>“As if a lad like you could match me in craftiness!
Well, I was in the bank to deposit some
funds of the Camwell Steel Company. It may
interest you to know that I am now their trusted
employee and chemical expert. I saw you and
recognized you, though you did not, of course,
recall me, for since our encounter, you see, I wear
a beard.”</p>

<p>From Jack’s position he could not see this, but
he fully recognized the fact that to escape the
vigilance of the authorities Duke must have disguised
himself, for full descriptions of him had
been sent out, following the outrage committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
on Mr. Dancer. He said nothing, however, and
Duke resumed.</p>

<p>“I’m telling you this to flaunt you. To show
you what a fool a lad who thinks himself smart
can prove to be. I heard you draw your money
at the bank, and slipped into another machine, a
small car belonging to the company.</p>

<p>“I saw you talking in low voices and then, as
you rounded a corner beyond which was a factory
blank wall, I saw you place the money in
your shoes. Of course I was out of the machine
then, but I guessed what you were going
to do and hid behind a big pile of steel rails.
Maybe you recall seeing them? Or were you
too busy transferring your bills?”</p>

<p>Jack did indeed recall now the pile of steel rails,
rusted and neglected, lying piled against the factory
wall. The place had appeared deserted, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
he had given it careful scrutiny for signs of life
before he and Tom produced their money and
transferred it to its new abiding place. How he
wished now that he had looked behind that pile
of rails!</p>

<p>“So now that you see there is no use of trying
evasion with me, I’ll have Blinky and Duggan
take off your shoes and relieve you of your
wealth. It’s too much coin for a young chap like
you to have, anyhow.”</p>

<p>At this stroke of humor the two individuals
mentioned broke into a harsh laugh. In fact,
they appeared to think it the best joke in the
world. As for Jack, in his bitter chagrin, he said
nothing. If only they had taken out the money
the last thing before they left town, he thought.
But then he recalled, as a partial palliation of his
bitter feelings, that the bank had closed long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
before they could, by any possibility, have concluded
the marketing for their voyage.</p>

<p>He felt Blinky and his companion draw off his
shoes and rifle them of his money.</p>

<p>“Now the other,” ordered Duke.</p>

<p>“All right, boss, but I guess he’ll give less
trouble than this kid,” growled Blinky.</p>

<p>“You mean that you hit him pretty hard?”</p>

<p>“Well, so hard that he wasn’t saying nothing
when I left him,” was the brutal reply.</p>

<p>Jack’s flesh crept. Could they mean that Tom,
bravely defending himself, had been badly hurt
by this ruffian? But the next minute he experienced
at least some partial measure of relief.</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared, boss,” (Duke’s face must
have looked anxious in the yellow lantern light),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
“it was just a love tap; but young whippersnappers
like him ain’t used to such.”</p>

<p>“Well, get the money and then bring it here,”
ordered Duke.</p>

<p>As he spoke, Jack caught the sound of the rustle
of bills. Evidently then the money had been
transferred to Duke for division with his satellites
later. The footsteps of Blinky and Duggan
could be heard trampling off in the brush.</p>

<p>“What are they going to do with us?” Jack
wondered. “Poor old Tom,” was his next
thought, “knocked down—and—out by that rascal!
I wish I was free, although,” he admitted
with a sigh, “I couldn’t do much against this
bunch.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy heard a slight spatter on the
dusty ground in front of him.</p>

<p>“Confound it, rain coming up,” he heard Duke
explain to himself.</p>

<p>Then the man who stood over Jack’s recumbent
form must have looked up at the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>“We’re going to get a storm, too,” Jack heard
him mutter.</p>

<p>The drops began to fall faster and faster. Out
of the distance came a low growl of thunder.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” Jack heard Duke urge. “Bring
that other kid here and tie him. We’ll put ’em
both in that old barn. They’re too young to get
wet and it is going to be a sharp storm.”</p>

<p>“All right, boss,” came back Blinky’s voice,
“we’ve got the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what to do with it. Bring
it here,” responded Duke peremptorily.</p>

<p>“You ain’t going to forget us, boss?” came in
Duggan’s voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>
<p>“Not likely; when I told you to follow me from
the factory and help in this little job I knew
I’d have to pay you to keep your mouths
shut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! All right!” hailed back Blinky.
“We know you’re all right, boss.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Jack heard Tom’s unconscious
form being dragged up. Then he himself
was laid hold of by Duggan, while Duke aided
Blinky with Tom.</p>

<p>The lightning was now flashing incessantly
and the angry growling of the thunder was getting
momentarily closer.</p>

<p>“They ought to thank us for getting them out
of the wet,” remarked Duke with grim humor as
he aided Blinky to drag Tom across the road toward
the barn. As for Duggan, he easily handled
Jack, tied as the lad was.</p>

<p>As Duggan raised him to hurl him into the
barn a bright flash showed Jack that the place
was a gaunt, rat-haunted old structure, half filled
with hay near the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>“I’ve slept in lots worse places,” remarked
Blinky as he saw the accommodations.</p>

<p>“Jail, for instance,” thought Jack, “and nobody
ever deserved it better.”</p>

<p>But he kept his thoughts to himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>THE TABLES ARE TURNED.</small></h2>


<p>Amidst a continuous roar and rattle of thunder
and flashing of vivid lightning, Jack and the still
unconscious Tom were thrown, none too gently,
into the old barn. Luckily, the soft nest of hay
saved them from bruises.</p>

<p>“Now let’s be getting back to the car,” exclaimed
Duke.</p>

<p>“How about splitting that money right now?”
growled Duggan.</p>

<p>“That will wait.”</p>

<p>“It won’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I say it will.”</p>

<p>There came a blinding glare of lightning.
Jack, who was now lying on his side, saw Duk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>e’s
face, even as a flashlight illumines the countenances
of a party waiting to have their pictures
taken in a dark room. It was livid and evil, but
determined.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, eh, Mister Duke?”</p>

<p>There was a panther-like snarl in Blinky’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I do, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t. You split it right here and
now.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; do as Blinky tells yer.”</p>

<p>This time the menace in Duggan’s tone was
unveiled. He made a step toward Duke. The
other recoiled. It was plain then that he feared
his desperate employees.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Duggan,” warned Blinky, who appeared
the more pacific of the two.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>
<p>“What for? We were chumps ever to have
given him the money.”</p>

<p>“How do ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, couldn’t we have knocked him on the
head and got away with it, eh? That’s what I’d
like to know.”</p>

<p>Duggan’s voice held a high, angry note.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d all get to fighting among themselves,”
thought Jack. “What’s that old saying,
‘When thieves fall out, honest men come into
their own’?”</p>

<p>“Come, Duke, give us our money. Then you
take your car—the one you brought us here in
ahead of the boys—and get out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the car’s hidden in the bushes yonder.
Give us our money, go start your car, and then
we’ll go our way and you yours. You won’t see
us again.”</p>

<p>“In any case,” growled Duggan.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ’any case’?” snarled
Duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>It was plain enough to Jack that he had
planned to make dupes of the two men and take
all the money. Now that his plans were frustrated,
he was by turns humble and threatening.</p>

<p>“None of your impudence,” he growled;
“aren’t you under me in the works? Don’t your
jobs depend on me?”</p>

<p>“No more than yours depends on our keeping
our mouths shut,” ground out Blinky.</p>

<p>“Aw, stow all this lip.”</p>

<p>Duggan shot out the words with menace. His
eyes blazed.</p>

<p>“Look here, Duke, yes or no? Play or quit?
Money or no money? Ah, you would, would
you?”</p>

<p>Duke, as if by magic, had produced a pistol
and was leveling it at the others. But Duggan
was fully his match. A quick jab of his fist, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
twist of his wrist, and the revolver went flying
out of his hand. It spun through the air toward
Jack, landing in the hay close beside the boy.
Before any of the three quarreling men knew exactly
what had occurred, Jack was facing them,
the pistol just knocked out of Duke’s clasp in
his hand.</p>

<p>It did not waver as it swept the semi-circle of
desperadoes. Blank astonishment was written
on their faces as a flash showed them their boyish
defier and the formidable weapon—it was an automatic
of the latest type—that he grasped.</p>

<p>“Confound you, how did you get that pistol?”
bellowed Duke irately.</p>

<p>The others, their late troubles forgotten, made
as if to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>“Look out. I’m nervous and my hand might
shake,” warned Jack, a mischievous sense of hu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>mor
overcoming him at their panic. “If it ever
did,” he went on, “ten shots would come out of
this gun—all at once!”</p>

<p>“You—you—young——” sputtered Duke impotently.
He almost appeared to foam at the
mouth. “Your hands were tied. How did you
get them free, you young jackanapes?”</p>

<p>“No conjurer is bound to tell the secret of his
tricks, Mr. Duke,” rejoined Jack, who was actually
beginning to enjoy the humor of the situation.
“Isn’t it enough that I have got them free,
and that you threw me your pistol? That was
real kind of you.”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t throw it to you, you young rascal.
Those scoundrels, Blinky and Duggan, jerked up
my arm.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the deed for the will,” declared Jack
with perfect coolness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> “Don’t move, any of you.
I’d hate to discharge this thing.”</p>

<p>Duggan sputtered like a dumb animal, mad
with fury. He was past speech.</p>

<p>“It all comes from meddling with these ’Boy
Inventors,’” he growled. “I’ve heard of ’em before.
Nobody ever got ’em dead to rights yet.”</p>

<p>Flash! Bang! A blinding flash; an ear-splitting
crash! The earth seemed to be suddenly
bathed in blue flame, while the air sizzled with
crackling electricity. Then came a deafening
explosion and a still brighter flash of light.</p>

<p>Jack thought he heard a cry, but before he
could make certain he himself toppled over.</p>

<p>A bolt of lightning had struck the old barn,
felling also all three actors in the drama at which
we have been onlookers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>HEAVEN’S INTERVENTION.</small></h2>


<p>Luckily, Jack had received but a small portion
of the electric fluid. It was only a few minutes
after the bolt had struck the barn with such a
deafening crash and such startling results, that
he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“What on earth has happened?” were his first
thoughts. “Where am I? Oh, I know, in that
old barn. They threw us in here and by good
luck I cut my finger slightly on an old grass hook
which had been left on top of the hay. That
gave me an idea and I easily cut my bonds by
leaning back against its sharp edge and gently
sawing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>
<p>“Then that gun came flying through the air
and I grabbed it up. I guessed that Duke was
the only one in the party that had one, and knew
it, too, for he had no fear in threatening his two
accomplices. Then came that thunderbolt. My!
how my head aches and——”</p>

<p>He broke off short. Smoke puffed in his face
and the hay behind him broke into a lurid flame.
The light showed that the bolt had ripped a hole
in the roof of the barn and had then buried itself
in the hay not ten feet from where Jack and Tom
lay, setting fire to it.</p>

<p>The flames had hardly made themselves manifest
before they were shooting up brightly toward
the roof.</p>

<p>“My! That bolt must have struck mighty close
to me!” thought Jack. “I’m lucky to be alive.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get out of here,” he added the next
instant;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> “that fire’s burning like a box factory.
Come on, Tom!”</p>

<p>He shook his comrade’s shoulder, but the other
only moaned.</p>

<p>“That brute struck him a terrible blow,” exclaimed
Jack; “but thank goodness, he appears to
have some color in his face now, though he must
have been mighty pale for a time. Well, that’s
a good sign.”</p>

<p>He bent over his comrade, and while the flames
crackled and roared furiously upward he dragged
Tom out of their reach, across the door-sill of
the barn and out into the fresh air. As he did
so, he stumbled over a recumbent form near the
door.</p>

<p>It was Blinky. Close by were the insensible
bodies of Duggan and Duke.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get Tom to a safe and comfortable
place before I bother about them,” thought Jack.</p>

<p>The flames were leaping up through the hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
in the roof, lighting up the whole neighborhood
as plain as day. By their glare Jack found a
bed of soft fern and laid his chum’s still form
upon it. Then he went back for the other victims
of the lightning, for he knew that if they
lay where they were the flames would soon become
hot enough to scorch them.</p>

<p>One by one the boy pluckily dragged the heavy
forms of the men who a short time since were
trying to do him harm, to a place of safety. By
the time he had finished, there was a glare coming
from the burning barn that was as bright as
the blaze of a thousand arc lights. Glancing over
toward Tom, Jack was overjoyed to see his cousin
sitting up with his eyes open and gazing somewhat
dazedly about him.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness you’re better, Tom,” he cried,
hastening toward his chum, for he had ascer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>tained
that Duke and his cronies were only insensible
and probably would recover possession
of their faculties shortly.</p>

<p>Pending this time, Jack had bound their hands
and feet securely with some light rope he had
found on a fence near the barn.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” gasped Tom, gazing
about him in the glow of the flaming barn.
“What’s on fire? Where are we?”</p>

<p>“Not a hundred yards from where we stopped
the machine, Tom. Those rascals lying bound
yonder knocked you insensible and overpowered
me. They had found out about the money in our
shoes. By the way, one of them is our old friend
Duke.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! Adam Duke?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>“But how did he come to be here?”</p>

<p>“Struck by lightning like that barn was, and
like I was, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No; but I mean how did he come to be at the
place he was when we were attacked?”</p>

<p>“The old fox saw us draw our money and
drove ahead of us to this lonely place in a machine
that belongs to a workshop that employs
him.”</p>

<p>“He trailed us in Camwell, then?”</p>

<p>Tom appeared to be still a bit dazed, and Jack
decided to defer the details of the story to some
more appropriate time and place.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it later on,” he said
hastily; “right now I want to recover some stolen
property from the inside coat pocket of our
friend, Mr. Duke, who, I perceive, is beginning
to move.”</p>

<p>This was true. As well as his bonds would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
permit him, Duke was stirring uneasily. Presently
his two companions began to move, too.
At first they were too confused in their ideas to
notice that they were bound.</p>

<p>“Where are we—in jail?” demanded Blinky.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” replied Duggan in a flat, weak
voice, “what d’you think?”</p>

<p>Plainly, and quite believably, both were not unfamiliar
with the state’s free lodging house to
which they had reference.</p>

<p>“No; you’re not in jail, you rascals, though
you richly deserve to be,” exclaimed Jack, stepping
forward. “Duke, give me those bills you
stole from us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it,” warned Duggan.</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to him,” retorted Jack, “it
will be best for you to give them up at once.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“You are bound fast and tight and cannot escape.
If you refuse to tell me whereabouts they
are on you, I shall summon the authorities, leaving
my cousin to guard you with the pistol you
were kind enough to present to me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll smart for this! See if you don’t! I’ll
fix you sooner or later. I’ll——” warned Duke
furiously.</p>

<p>A quick, certain footstep sounded behind them.</p>

<p>Then came a sharp, imperative voice, with a
marked New England twang.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>
<p>“What in ’tarnation’s all this yar?”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>AN INSUFFICIENT DISGUISE.</small></h2>


<p>Jack turned quickly and found himself facing
a tall, lanky, sharp-featured man dressed in
homespun clothes and cowhide boots. On his
chin was a fine specimen of the type of facial
adornment popularly known as a billy-goat. On
his chest flashed a huge nickel star.</p>

<p>“Stand where ye are, by gosh!” he warned.</p>

<p>“Why,” began Jack, “I’ve——”</p>

<p>“No lip, young feller!”</p>

<p>The constable, for such he evidently was, drew
out a huge old-fashioned revolver and flourished
it.</p>

<p>“Look out what you’re doing with that,”
warned Tom, whose sense of humor had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
back again with his recovered good health, and
who was now an interested spectator of the
scene.</p>

<p>The constable glared at him, as if undecided
whether or no he was being made fun of. The
boys now saw what they had not noticed before,
that quite a crowd, made up of farming folks attracted
by the glare of the flames, had assembled.
No effort was made to put out the fire. It had
gone too far for that. The barn’s heaviest timbers
showed now like a row of blackened, stumpy
fangs against the red glare of the flames within.
The roof had fallen in long since.</p>

<p>“Wall, I swan to goodness!” demanded one
old gaffer in the crowd, “what’s all this, Officer
Hake?”</p>

<p>“By hemlock, I don’ jes’ know, Squar’,” came
the reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> “I seen ther flames same as you did,
an’ hitched up ole Bess yonder ter drive out
hyar.”</p>

<p>“Go on, officer,” said the old man who had been
addressed as “Squar’,” with judicial coolness.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I found ther barn all on fire—it’s Gus
Davis’s, Squar’,—an’ these two young fellers
lookin’ about dazed-like, while them three characters
yonder lay bound on ther ground.”</p>

<p>The squire expectorated profusely.</p>

<p>“Great Doctors!” he exclaimed, “I’ll call court
right hyar an’ inquire inter this. Young feller,
in ther name of ther great an’ sov’ran commonwealth
of Massachusetts, do you—wa’al, what
yer got ter say fer yerself?”</p>

<p>“Just this, sir,” and Jack related a plain,
straightforward story, while in that odd, flame-lit
courtroom the rugged-faced farm men and
women pressed eagerly about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>The judge appeared impressed.</p>

<p>“Got ther numbers of them thar notes?” he
asked sharply, referring to Jack’s declaration that
they were in Duke’s pocket.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Jack produced a memorandum and read off the
numbers of the stolen notes. The old squire
checked them off as Jack read them, in a battered
old sealskin wallet with silver trimmings worn
with age.</p>

<p>“Orf’cer Hake.”</p>

<p>The order came as Jack finished reading, repeating
each number to make sure that the squire
jotted them down right.</p>

<p>“Go look in that feller’s pockets an’ see if you
kin find them banknotes.”</p>

<p>While Duke, pale as ashes, struggled and
swore, he was rigidly searched. The notes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
found in his inside pocket just as Jack had said
they would be.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, by gum, young feller,” said the squire
as the rural constable handed the bundle to him
for inspection, “that part of yer story’s right.
Now for the next.”</p>

<p>He adjusted his spectacles and glanced rapidly
at each note, checking them off as he went along.
As he concluded, he turned to Jack.</p>

<p>“Gimme your hand, young feller,” he said
warmly, “thet’s a right smart, slick bit o’ work
you done.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Jack, “but there’s more to be
said yet, your honor. That man lying yonder
from whom the notes were recovered, is Adam
Duke, a fugitive from justice.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” howled Duke, beside himself with
fright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>“You told me so yourself,” went on Jack
calmly. “Besides, I recognized your voice.”</p>

<p>“What, that thar feller’s Adam Duke!” exclaimed
the constable incredulously. “Why, I
got ther circular hyar what describes him. Duke
had a moustache, this fellow has a beard.”</p>

<p>“I half suspect it’s false,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>There was still a ruddy light from the fire and
the squire decided to test this part of Jack’s story,
even though he had already determined to hold
the man on suspicion. Besides, in any event,
there was the highway robbery charge against
him.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! All a lie, I tell you!” roared Duke
as they examined his glossy, luxuriant beard. It
did indeed seem too close to the real article for
an assumed imitation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>
<p>“By heck, young feller, that beard’s as gen-u-ine
an article as my goatee,” declared the constable.</p>

<p>Several others echoed this opinion. Even the
village barber, for the burned barn was close to
a small hamlet named Hexham, declared that he
would stake his professional reputation on the
veracity of the bound man’s whiskers.</p>

<p>But alas for all these wiseacres! The heavy
rain accompanying the storm had done what
nothing else could have accomplished, without
design on Duke’s part.</p>

<p>It had loosened the foundation which stuck the
hairy growth to his face. Jack, determined in
his own mind from Duke’s frightened look that
he had hit the right nail on the head, gave the
whiskers a good tug.</p>

<p>They peeled off like a porous plaster, while
the crowd yelled and Duke swore. Stripped of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
his disguise, Duke’s face was instantly recognized
from the portrait which adorned the police
circular. Two hours later he and his cronies
were in the Hexham lock-up, waiting to be taken
to the county seat for trial.</p>

<p>It may as well be set down here that at the
subsequent proceedings, inasmuch as the chief
complainants did not appear, all three got light
sentences, the judge remarking that they were
extraordinarily lucky.</p>

<p>But while that trial was going on our young
friends were facing dangers and difficulties in
tropic waters to which all that had gone before
appeared tame. Their return with their supplies
to Mr. Dancer’s workshop and their stories of
the night’s events, had resulted only in the <i>White
Shark’s</i> not clearing on her adventurous cruise
till early dawn. Otherwise their start for Cuba
was made as previously planned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>Nobody saw the dull white form of the diving
boat slip seaward and then head due south. Had
any persons witnessed the departure, they would
not have had long in which to watch it, nor could
they have explained the phenomenon of the queer
form slipping through the quiet sea and then suddenly
vanishing from view.</p>

<p>Had they attempted it, another “sea-serpent
story” might have enlivened the columns of the
newspapers, for, as the <i>White Shark</i> got beyond
shallow water, she dived like one of her vicious
namesakes—the tigers of the deep—and the
waters closed over her.</p>

<small>A NAVAL ENCOUNTER.</small></h2>


<p>“Jack, this is glorious!”</p>

<p>“You may well say that, Tom. I’m enjoying
myself as much as if I were on a vacation.”</p>

<p>At twenty-five knots an hour the <i>White Shark</i>
was cutting along on her voyage to the south.
The sea was smooth, but it rippled just enough
for the brisk, salt-laden breeze to blow an occasional
shower of brine over the two lads standing
on the rounded back of the novel submarine craft.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the second day out. So
far everything had gone without a hitch. The
machinery was running so smoothly that Silas
Hardtack had been left on watch in the engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
room, while the boys came up on deck to inhale
a whiff of the fresh sea breeze.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick was busy over some problems
connected with a new type of threshing machine
he was evolving for the use of the government
in experimental work. Jupe was busy in his
galley. From time to time, through a ventilator
which was kept open while the <i>White Shark</i> was
on the surface in fair weather, there floated up
to the boys the rattle of dishes and the appetizing
smells of the dinner that Jupe was preparing.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an appetite like a horse, Jack.”</p>

<p>“So have I. Nothing like what poets call the
‘balmy breeze’ to give you that.”</p>

<p>Through the open hatchway appeared another
figure, that of Silas Hardtack. The old man was
a practical navigator, and as he came on deck
he brought with him his sextant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>“Eight bells,” he announced, “I’m going to
shoot the sun.”</p>

<p>“Fire away,” chuckled Jack, “but don’t shoot
it out.”</p>

<p>Old Silas raised the sextant to his eye and
aimed it at the sun. Then he gazed at the marked
arc of the instrument and made a swift mental
calculation.</p>

<p>“How are we getting along?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p>“Wait till I get it worked out, Master Jack,”
responded the old salt, “but we’ve been making
twenty-five miles an hour for the last forty-eight
hours. I only hope this weather lasts.”</p>

<p>“Same here; it’s important we should make a
rapid run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>“Yes; from what I know of those Cubans,
they’re a bad lot when they get scrapping. But
bless you, if we had the old <i>Ohio</i> along we could
blow the whole island into the water if we wanted
to.”</p>

<p>“I hope we wouldn’t want to do anything like
that,” exclaimed Tom, “it must be a very interesting
place to visit.”</p>

<p>“I read up on its history a bit before we left
home,” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“Ah, and what do the books say about it?”
asked Silas. “They’re mostly wrong, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I remember, if you like,”
volunteered Jack.</p>

<p>“All right, heave ahead, my hearty, but don’t
make it too long; I’ve got to get back and give
them engines a good drink of oil.”</p>

<p>“Cuba is the largest of the West Indian Islands,”
began Jack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> “It is very mountainous, but
possesses few rivers of any size. The coasts are
said to be very bad. Long reefs run far out to
sea.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, I’ve been aground on one of ’em on
the old <i>Ohio</i>,” struck in Silas.</p>

<p>“I hope we’ll not get into any trouble of that
kind,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“The island, which is 43,500 square miles in
area, was discovered by Columbus in 1492. The
Spanish occupation dates from a short period
after that time. There have been numerous
revolutions. In fact, the history of the island
appears to be one of unrest; but since 1898, when
the United States intervened and freed Cuba,
there has been much less trouble. Still, as you
know from the papers, there has been plenty of
unrest from time to time.”</p>

<p>“Are there any wild animals there?” asked
Tom, who liked hunting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>
<p>“Very few. Wild pigs and a few deer. There
are boa constrictors, though, and large lizards of
various kinds.”</p>

<p>“How about gold or silver?”</p>

<p>“Very little. Not enough to make it profitable
to prospect or mine for either of them. There is
plenty of iron, though, most of the mines being
located near to Santiago, at the mouth of which
harbor, as you know, Uncle Sam’s navy licked
the Spaniards off the face of the map.”</p>

<p>“I wish the old <i>Ohio</i> could have been there,”
sighed Silas; “she’d have shown how Yankees
can fight. Well, thank you, lad, for your yarn.
Now I’ll get below. Don’t forget you relieve me
in a short time.”</p>

<p>“We won’t forget, Silas. We’re anxious to
see how far we’ve come.”</p>

<p>When they went below they found out. In the
forty-eight hours or more that she had been under
way, the <i>White Shark</i> had made twelve
hundred miles, which Silas declared was a
“bumper” run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>While he hastened forward to communicate the
results of his observations to Mr. Dancer, Tom
and Jack examined the chart which was still
spread out. It showed that they were about off
the “Capes.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me I read something about the
Atlantic fleet being ordered to Europe before
long,” said Jack. “What if they should be
steaming out from the Capes now? You know
they rendezvoused at Newport News.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get a glass and go on deck and see if we
can sight anything,” suggested Tom. “If they
are steaming to sea we ought to be able to see
them.”</p>

<p>“All right. Just wait till I find out if everything
is running smoothly and I’ll go with you.
We don’t have to stand by for orders now.”</p>

<p>A thorough investigation was made by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
young engineer, the result of which showed that
everything was running in fine shape. Armed
with the binoculars, the two boys went on deck.
Tom was the first to gaze westward. Then came
Jack’s turn.</p>

<p>Of course the shore was invisible, for their
course compelled them to be many miles out at
sea, but Jack thought he saw a dark blur on the
horizon.</p>

<p>“Take a look, Tom,” he urged, “and see what
you make it out to be. It looks like a steamer’s
smoke.”</p>

<p>Tom took the glasses and gazed long and steadily
in the direction Jack had indicated.</p>

<p>“It is smoke,” he announced presently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> “Gee
whiz, Jack, whatever is making it is coming toward
us, too. What if they should be Uncle
Sam’s ships steaming eastward!”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said a quiet voice behind them,
“I think we should be justified in heading toward
them and giving them a chance to look us over.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one way of putting it,” laughed
Jack, for the newcomer was Mr. Chadwick, who
had seen the boys going on deck with the binoculars
and had arrived in time to overhear Tom’s
last words.</p>

<p>“There are several columns of smoke,” cried
Tom, after another long look.</p>

<p>“That appears to make it conclusive that it is
the fleet,” said Mr. Chadwick. “I know they
were to sail for the Mediterranean station about
this time. Boys, we ought to have a fine marine
spectacle. I’ll go below and consult Mr. Dancer.”</p>

<p>While he was below, the boys kept the glasses
busy, focusing them on what were now, beyond
a doubt, as many as a dozen columns of black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
smoke. Before long they could make out dark
hulls and odd-looking masts rising above the
horizon.</p>

<p>“Go below and tell them the news,” cried Jack,
“and, oh, Tom, bring up the flag.”</p>

<p>He referred to the ensign which could be fitted
into a socket astern when it was desirable to fly
“Old Glory.”</p>

<p>Tom soon reappeared with Mr. Chadwick and
old Silas. Mr. Dancer would not leave the wheel
of his craft even to see a naval parade under such
unique conditions. Of course the periscope afforded
him a limited view of the inspiring sight.</p>

<p>Before long the monster war dogs were plainly
visible and the glasses were no longer needful.
There were eight of the ships—huge, formidable
craft, painted the dull gray that is Uncle Sam’s
fighting color. At the bow of each, as they came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
on, a creamy wave of foam curled up, and at the
rails of the bridge of the foremost craft a group
of officers could be seen pointing at the strange
object their glasses had just “picked up,” and
which “strange object” was, of course, the submarine
<i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>The battleships were steaming “in column,”
that is, in single file. Each preserved its correct
distance from the other, varying hardly an inch
as they progressed.</p>

<p>Right up alongside the leader of the column
ran the little <i>White Shark</i>. From the vast, lofty
decks of the battleship she must have looked
like some marine monster with—by some Jonah-like
miracle—a crew of men and boys on her
curved back.</p>

<p>The jackies lined the rails in crowds as the big
vessel drew up closer. Every one on board ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>peared
to be aware of the presence of the submarine.
Bright colored flags appeared in strings
signaling from ship to ship the news.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer ran the <i>White Shark</i> into what appeared
to be quite dangerous proximity to the
big craft. But fast as the battleships were
steaming, the <i>White Shark</i> kept pace with them.
From the bridge inquiries were showered as to
the nature of the submarine and whither she was
bound. To these, evasive answers were returned,
as it was not deemed advisable for the destination
of the submarine to be known.</p>

<p>All at once, as the tiny metal chip of a <i>White
Shark</i> rushed along by the side of the huge
leviathan of naval warfare, an object clothed in
white fell from the stern deck. Like a flash it
darted downward.</p>

<p>For an instant the watchers on the deck of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
submarine thought something had been thrown
overboard from the cook’s or quartermaster’s
section of the ship.</p>

<p>But a moment later a booming, roaring cry ran
along the battleship’s crowded decks. Her steam
siren shrieked like the wail of a lost soul.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“It’s a man overboard!” cried Silas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> “That’s
what it is!”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>FRESH DANGER.</small></h2>


<p>“Man overboard!”</p>

<p>The cry that never fails to thrill the heart of
every sailor rang out on the deck of the submarine,
as old Silas rightly interpreted the uproar
on the battleship. Far above them boats were
swung out and crews rushed into them. From
the stern of the big fighting ship life belts and
lines were tossed.</p>

<p>But long before any of the man-o’-war’s boats
could touch the water, the submarine was headed
about and rushed at full speed toward a tiny
black object bobbing on the water far astern of
the cumbrous battleship.</p>

<p>That object, looking no bigger than a shoe but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>ton,
was a man fighting for his life in the wake
of the ship from which he had been lost. Mr.
Dancer, in the steering section of the <i>White
Shark</i>, had seen the accident reflected in the periscope.
His mind was made up in an instant.
Using the emergency appliances he had for handling
the engines, he had brought the <i>White
Shark</i> around in incredibly short time and had
headed for the drowning man.</p>

<p>Up on deck Jack and Tom had their shoes and
their coats off, ready to leap after the castaway
if necessary. Mr. Chadwick had seized a life-saving
buoy from its hook just inside the hatch
and stood ready to hurl it. As for old Silas, he
shouted:</p>

<p>“Hold on, mate! We’re comin’! Hold on!”</p>

<p>The sea was not in itself rough, but in the wake
of the speeding battleship it was decidedly so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
The <i>White Shark</i> rolled and plunged like an
empty bottle as, at express speed, she cut through
the boiling mass of foam and angry, choppy
waves.</p>

<p>“He’s still afloat!” cried Tom, as the <i>White
Shark</i> rose on the top of a wave and they saw
the head of the swimmer they were going to save,
if human aid could do it.</p>

<p>“And making a brave fight for his life, too,”
cried Jack. “Fight on, old fellow, we’re coming.”</p>

<p>The man waved a hand as the <i>White Shark</i>
ranged close to him. Before any of those on
deck knew what he was going to do, Jack was
overboard. In a few strong strokes he was alongside
his man. The next minute they saw Jack
clutched with the desperate grip of the drowning,
and dragged under water.</p>

<p>“He’ll drown!” cried Tom despairingly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
the next instant he, too, was overboard and striking
out for the spot where the two swimmers who
had vanished had last been seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly they flashed to the surface, and Tom
saw, to his huge delight, that Jack had broken the
other’s grip and was now swimming with an unconscious
burden.</p>

<p>“I had to almost knock his head off before he’d
let go,” panted Jack, as Tom swam up.</p>

<p>“Where’s the <i>White Shark</i>? You can’t hold
him up much longer.”</p>

<p>“Here she comes! Hurray!”</p>

<p>The submarine slowly ranged up to the group
in the water, and Mr. Chadwick threw the life
belt. Tom caught it and the two boys thrust it
over the unconscious man’s head. Then, while
they swam alongside, holding on to the belt, Mr.
Chadwick and Silas hauled in on the line attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
to it. In this way they reached the side of the
submarine and were pulled on deck almost exhausted.</p>

<p>They had hardly reached safety when Mr.
Chadwick gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Look!” he shouted, “look!”</p>

<p>Coming right at them was something they had
quite forgotten. The second battleship in the
long column of sea fighters!</p>

<p>She was close enough to them to make her bow
look like a steel cliff. They could almost hear
the roar of her cutwater as it cleaved its way
through the sea.</p>

<p>“Come below instantly! Close the panel! It’s
our only chance!”</p>

<p>The voice was Mr. Dancer’s. It came from
the mouth of the speaking tube situated in the
hatch for purposes of communicating with the
deck from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Without stopping to take another look at the
huge menace bearing down upon them, the boys,
assisted by Silas, picked up the unconscious form
of the man they had rescued and carried him below.
All this was done with lightning speed.
Anxiety, cold panic, made them move like those
who dream, but still with promptitude.</p>

<p>As the metal door clanged to Jack shuddered;
it sounded almost as if the steel bow of the battleship
was cutting into them at the moment, cleaving
them in two and sending the <i>White Shark</i>
and her crew to an unmarked grave in the bed
of the ocean.</p>

<p>The diving boat gave a sickening plunge the
next instant. It seemed as if she were making an
almost perpendicular dive to the depths. Those
in the cabin who had rushed from the deck in the
nick of time were thrown in a bruised mass at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
end of the main cabin. As for Jupe, only a wild
yell proceeded from his regions. He had no idea
of what was happening.</p>

<p>It appeared to him that the <i>White Shark</i> was
taking her last plunge. It seemed that way to
the others, too. Huddled together, they turned
white, questioning faces on each other. Not even
the unconscious man was more deadly pale.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke, but each knew without resorting
to words, of what the other was thinking.</p>

<p>Had the dive come too late to carry the <i>White
Shark</i> safely under the keel of the battleship
driving down upon them?</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a grating, grinding shock
that seemed to shake the <i>White Shark</i> to the last
rivet of her fabric.</p>

<p>“Great heaven! They’ve struck us!” cried
Silas in a terrible voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“We’re going to the bottom!” shouted Tom
beside himself with terror.</p>

<p>The submarine hesitated for an instant, and
then turned slowly on one side.</p>

<p>“It’s the end!” cried Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>A NARROW ESCAPE.</small></h2>


<p>For one sickening instant the diving craft
shuddered and shivered like a stricken live thing.
All the while the dull whirr of the engines, the
thrill of the cylinder of metal in which six human
lives were at stake, continued.</p>

<p>To the huddled mass piled together in inextricable
confusion at one end of the main cabin,
the brief space of time that ensued between the
crash of the battleship’s impact and the slow,
shuddering recovery of the submarine, appeared
to be hours. In reality it was but minutes.</p>

<p>Any one of them, except perhaps Jupe, would
have willingly faced death on land had it been
inevitable. But penned in a metal cylinder under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the depths of the ocean, things were very different.</p>

<p>However, forward in the steering compartment
was the guiding spirit of the occasion. Not
for an instant did Daniel Dancer, dreamer and
inventor, swerve from his post or his duty. With
quick, sure fingers he manipulated the emergency
machinery following the crash. For aught he
knew, at any instant through a wound in the side
of the almost human craft he had created the
water might come pouring in.</p>

<p>But although his face was deathly pale he controlled
the machinery with a heavy hand. When
the crash came his heart had bounded to his
mouth. Like Mr. Chadwick he had murmured to
himself:</p>

<p>“It is the end!”</p>

<p>With indomitable pluck he stuck to his post,
but his pale lips moved as if in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>One! two! three minutes passed, and still came
no sign that the blow dealt the <i>White Shark</i> had
been a mortal one. Her engines buzzed steadily
on. Glancing almost fearfully at the array of
indicators in front of him, the inventor manipulated
the devices which he knew would show the
slightest injury to the craft they controlled.</p>

<p>But one after another they responded. The
<i>White Shark</i> was in perfect control.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible, after that fearful blow?”
breathed Daniel Dancer, half afraid to believe the
good fortune which investigation showed him
must be his.</p>

<p>He set the craft on an even keel and hailed the
others.</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick’s voice came back:</p>

<p>“How is it, Dancer? Tell us the worst.”</p>

<p>“The best, you mean,” cried the joyous in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>ventor.
“By a stroke of miraculous fortune, that
battleship only struck us a glancing blow, although
if it had been a fraction of an inch
nearer——”</p>

<p>His voice trailed off hesitatingly. He could
not trust himself to speak. Men who have looked
into their tombs and then beheld themselves
snatched back to earth again, are not given to
much speech.</p>

<p>The others came crowding into the steering
chamber. Wonder was on every face and a sort
of reverent look, too. Each felt that only divine
Providence could have saved them in that fearful
moment.</p>

<p>“The <i>White Shark</i> is not damaged at all?” demanded
Mr. Chadwick incredulously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>
<p>“Not a bit. Hark at her engines. I expect our
back is dented, but outside of that I anticipate
finding no considerable damage.”</p>

<p>“Den we ain’t done drownded at de bottom ob
de sea?”</p>

<p>The voice came in a plaintive wail from the
door of the steering chamber. In it was framed
the white-aproned form of Jupe. His face was
gray and his eyes rolled like saucers.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Jupe,” laughed Mr. Chadwick happily,
such was his relief over their salvation from
a fearful death, “we’re still in the ring.”</p>

<p>“Das right, boss;” grinned Jupe, “and de dinner
am still on de wing. I was jes’ goin’ ter call
you alls when gollyumptions, dar come dat cantankerous
smash!</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lub ob goodness, boss,” he went on,
“what was dat hit us? Granddaddy whale or
suthin’?”</p>

<p>“Neither, Jupe; but a battleship.”</p>

<p>Jupe threw up his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“A battleship! Good lan’ ob Goshen, ah done
heah ob a locusmocus buttin’ ah niggah’s haid,
but I nebber heard tell ob a battleship hitting a
peanut like dis yar.”</p>

<p>“Peanut!” cried Jack with mock indignation.</p>

<p>“Ah jes’ means a menagerie peanut, Marse
Jack.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you find them, as a rule—in a
menagerie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’ mean dat peanut what you <i>eat</i>.
Ah mean, compahed wid dat battling ship dis yar
<i>White Shark</i> ain’ as big as a peanut to a whale,
no sah. But ah am certingly grossly ‘xaggerated
ter fin’ dat we am still in de water and not undah
it,” concluded Jupe, shuffling off to repair the
damage in his kitchen.</p>

<p>Luckily, most of the “china” was agate ware,
and the majority of the movable articles, includ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>ing
the kitchen utensils, were designed so to remain
stationary, so the damage was not as great
as might have been anticipated; but it was bad
enough.</p>

<p>“And now for the surface,” declared Mr. Dancer;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
“and, in the meantime, Chadwick, you had
better look at that half-drowned man. You’ll
find the medicine chest in my cabin.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE “WHITE SHARK” AND THE SQUADRON.</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Dancer worked on his odd-looking collection
of levers and buttons, and the <i>White Shark</i>
obediently shot upward, but, of course, not at
so sharp an angle as that at which she had descended
to escape the battleship’s prow. In a
few seconds she was near the surface, as the periscope
indicated.</p>

<p>To avoid the danger of coming up under another
battleship, which has, by the way, destroyed
dozens of submarines, Mr. Dancer rose to the
surface on a long, slanting course. As he glanced
at the periscope indicator he saw that they were
by no means too far off for safety—that is, had
the fleet been in motion. But the periscope dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>closed
it lying motionless, while small boats
dotted the water in every direction.</p>

<p>“Chadwick, how’s your patient?” called out
Mr. Dancer.</p>

<p>“Oh, better. He is sitting up. When we are
ready we can transfer him back to his ship.”</p>

<p>“That was a white thing you did for me,
mates,” declared the sailor, who told them that
his name was Jim Harding. “I’ll never forget it,
either, see if I do.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” declared Jack; “glad to get
you out safe and sound. But how did you come
to go overboard?”</p>

<p>“I dunno exactly. I was standing on the deck
rail with some of my mates, when all of a sudden
two fellers, skylarking behind me, bumped into
me. I guess I was too much interested in your
craft here to pay much attention to what I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
doing. The first thing you know I found myself
in the water. My! That was an awful struggle!
I guess I came pretty near taking you down
with me, too,” he went on, addressing Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, if you did, I gave you a good sound
crack on the head,” laughed Jack; “it was the
only thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Course it was, mate,” rejoined the other. “I
wondered what made my head so sore there.”</p>

<p>“Pigeon’s egg on it, eh?”</p>

<p>“All of that. Feels more like a turkey’s. Say,
this craft’s got any of our navy submarines
beat.”</p>

<p>At this instant Mr. Dancer’s voice came again.</p>

<p>“We are in the middle of the fleet,” he hailed.
“I’m going to play a trick, or, rather, I have
played it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>“Why, I’m running submerged with only just
the tip of the periscope out of the water. One
would have to have sharp eyes to see it yet. Although
we are twenty-five feet down, I can see
all that is on the surface of the water.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s the trick?” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“Have the panel ready to slide back. Then you
all get under it. When the companion way register
points to ‘Open!’ you operate the machinery
that slides it back.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Chadwick, “what are
your next instructions?”</p>

<p>“As soon as the panel is open, run out on deck
and give a good, hearty cheer. I’ll join you.”</p>

<p>They congregated under the panel.</p>

<p>“All right!” came Mr. Dancer’s voice after a
short interval.</p>

<p>Click! Back slid the panel. In rushed fresh
air and sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>“Now, boys, remember the instructions,” was
Jack’s father’s warning as they stumbled up the
steel steps toward the parallelogram of air and
light.</p>

<p>With great self-control the boys held back
their enthusiasm till ordered to “cut loose.” It
was the more hard to do this, as from every ship
came a deep, roaring and booming of cheers for
the plucky little submarine craft and her brave
ship’s company.</p>

<p>All about lay men-o’-war boats, ordered out on
a search, doubtless, and each huge battleship lay
motionless. It made a wonderful picture to the
group that stood on the drenched decks of the
submarine that had just risen from the depths, to
which not many minutes ago it had appeared that
she was consigned forever.</p>

<p>Practically every battleship in the squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
knew by wireless and signaling of what had occurred.
They had learned how the men on the
leading battleship, <i>Manhattan Island</i>, had seen
the submarine apparently rammed and sunk by
the craft second in line, the <i>San Francisco</i>. The
reappearance of the small diving craft was
deemed wonderful, because several of the keenest
sighted officers had been prepared to swear that
they saw the actual impact.</p>

<p>Wonderful enough, Old Glory, drenched and
dripping from the dive, still hung at the stern of
the <i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>“Jack, hustle astern and get those colors!”
cried Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>The boy hastened aft and released the flagpole
from its socket. Reverently he bore the colors
forward.</p>

<p>“Now wave them with all your might!” came
the order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>As Jack, with all the power his muscular young
arms could command, waved the colors, strenuously
renewed cheers came from the battleships.
They were in response to a burst of cheers from
the company of the <i>White Shark</i>, among whom
Jim Harding stood waving to his shipmates,—a
man literally snatched from a double grave.</p>

<p>Across the back of the submarine, almost
amidships, was a deep dent; but no other harm
had been done. The battleship had struck her
a glancing blow just as she dived, but had it come
an inch closer the injury would have proved fatal
to the career of the <i>White Shark</i> and its crew.</p>

<p>“Come aboard!” bellowed an officer of the
<i>Manhattan Island</i> as the <i>White Shark</i> moved
’longside the gangway to send the sailor Harding
back on board.</p>

<p>“No time. Thanks just the same,” rejoined
Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, thanks. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Jove, you are brave men, and those boys are
the salt of the earth,” came from another officer
on the bridge.</p>

<p>“You had a jolly close shave, though,” reminded
another. “We thought you were gone
for a minute.”</p>

<p>“So did we,” laughed Mr. Chadwick in response—“for
a minute.”</p>

<p>Surrounded by his mates, Harding made his
way up the gangway and on board, after bidding
a grateful farewell to those who had risked their
lives to save his. For half an hour pleasant chat
was exchanged, and the officers of the <i>San Francisco</i>
came rowing up and offered apologies for
having almost ended the <i>White Shark’s</i> existence.</p>

<p>They were accepted freely. Mr. Chadwick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
and Mr. Dancer fully understood that to check
the way of a big battleship, or even to alter her
course, is not the work of an instant. It was due
to this that the near-casualty had occurred, the
lookouts on the <i>San Francisco</i> not having seen
the inconspicuous part of the <i>White Shark</i> which
appeared above water till almost above her. It
was then too late.</p>

<p>The shock which had shaken the <i>White Shark</i>
to its bed plates had not been felt on the battleship
any more than a mosquito would be noticeable
to a mammoth. Even had the submarine
been cut in two, the shock would not have been
perceptible on the <i>San Francisco</i>.</p>

<p>“That just shows you that a ship might hit us
at night and they’d never know they’d sent us to
the bottom,” cried Tom in dismay.</p>

<p>“You’re a cheerful talker,” struck in Jack, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
was one of the group; “but come, there go the
signals to get under way. The boats are in, and
look at the smoke and steam pouring from the
funnels! Goodness, what a formidable-looking
fleet! Uncle Sam has no reason to be ashamed
of his navy.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” struck in Silas Hardtack;
“but on the old <i>Ohio</i> we thought we were pretty
good; and I guess we were, too,” he concluded
modestly.</p>

<p>Amidst waving and cheering and mutual
shouts of good will, the fleet swept by, the crew
of the <i>White Shark</i> standing respectfully at salute
as one after another the great vessels glided
past in stately procession.</p>

<p>At length the last of the column swept by, and
then, and only then, did the <i>White Shark</i> head
round once more on her course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>“We lost some time,” declared Mr. Chadwick
as they stood gazing after the fast diminishing
outlines of the battleships, “but it was worth
it.”</p>

<p>“An’ now, gents, am you comin’ to dat dinner,
or am yo’ gwine ter spite yo’ stomachs till supper
time?”</p>

<p>It was not till then that they recalled that they
had eaten nothing, all thoughts of food having
been swept aside by the excitement of the scenes
they had just gone through.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A MYSTERY ADRIFT.</small></h2>


<p>That night the watches at the steering appliance
were divided into four. Mr. Dancer who,
with the exception of a few brief snatches of
sleep, had been at the controls of the <i>White
Shark</i> almost continuously since the voyage had
started, went to his cabin right after supper.</p>

<p>Then came Tom’s watch, lasting from eight till
midnight. Jack’s followed, from midnight till
4 A. M., and Silas Hardtack’s from that hour till
8 A. M., when Mr. Dancer insisted that he would
be able to resume control.</p>

<p>This arrangement put at least one person who
understood the engines in the engine room constantly.
Mr. Chadwick watched while Jack
steered, sleeping from time to time; for it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
recalled that the engines were controllable from
the steering compartment, so that actually all the
engineer was compelled to do was to “stand by”
for signals and see that the motors were properly
lubricated and kept in order.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, when the signal sounded for
every one to turn out, Mr. Dancer emerged from
his cabin, looking, as Tom put it, “as fresh as a
daisy.” Each in turn took a salt water shower
in the bathroom, while the appetizing aroma of
Jupe’s bacon and coffee and hot biscuits filled the
main cabin.</p>

<p>Through the night the submarine had been run
at a distance of fifty feet below the surface of the
water, so as to avoid all risk of striking floating
objects or passing vessels. At such a depth the
craft was safe from the risk of contact with the
keels of even the largest ships.</p>

<p>It had seemed odd to the boys as they stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
their “tricks” at the wheel to think, as they alternately
eyed the compass and the observation
tube, that above them vessels might be passing
“on their lawful occasions,” wholly unconscious
of the “man-fish” cruising below them in the
quiet depths.</p>

<p>One thing, too, the boys noticed was the immense
amount of fish attracted by the glare from
the observation searchlights. Through the green,
pellucid water, illuminated by the bright light
from the observation tube, it at times appeared as
if they were gazing into a show tank in some vast
aquarium. Like most boys, Jack and Tom had
both read “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
Sea,” but even that fascinating history of life in
deep waters had failed to give them any idea of
the immense amount of life that goes on in the
submarine depths.</p>

<p>Of course, at the speed the <i>White Shark</i> kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
up—for time was imperative—it was impossible
to see much more of the fish than their fleeting
forms, like flocks of birds seen from a train window.
But even this was interesting. You may
be inclined to ask how the <i>White Shark</i> was kept
on her course without danger in the depths.</p>

<p>The answer is that she was guided just like
any other ship in the dark night, by her compass.
Before turning the watch over to the next man,
each occupant of the steering chair gave him the
direction in which Silas Hardtack, the ship’s
navigator, had ordered the prow to be kept. The
course was due south, and this made it doubly
easy to keep the <i>White Shark</i> on her true line of
progress.</p>

<p>As to depth, the chart showed ample water
everywhere, even should the <i>White Shark</i> traverse
the underwaters at a depth of two hundred
feet. But there was nothing to be gained by do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>ing
this, as, at such great depths, pressure and
friction would be so increased as to seriously impede
the submarine craft’s progress, and haste
was a necessity.</p>

<p>After this digression concerning the night, we
will follow the boys up to the deck after breakfast,
for at dawn the <i>White Shark</i> had been
driven to the surface and the ventilators opened.
While the air was not foul, still it was a relief to
open everything that could be opened, and set in
motion fans that drew the stale air out of the interior
of the craft.</p>

<p>As soon as their morning meal had been dispatched,
both boys hastened on deck. The sea
was still and calm, the air cool and clear and the
sky cloudless.</p>

<p>They were in the gulf stream, and the water
was of an intense blue. At the sides where the
Archimedian screws were biting steadily into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
water, it had a hue of the most transparent turquoise.
Great patches of yellow gulf-weed
floated everywhere, and as the <i>White Shark</i>
nosed through these, flying fish flew from them
in whole coveys.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the boys could not tire of
watching these strange fish, which, of course, do
not “fly” at all in the true sense, but skim the
water, supported by their broad fins.</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Hullo, yourself, Tom; what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Look yonder there, Jack. Don’t you see some
object?”</p>

<p>“I do, floating off to the eastward.”</p>

<p>“What can it be?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Looks as if it might be a boat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the glasses. We’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Tom dived below and reappeared with the
binoculars. A short scrutiny convinced them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
their eyes had not played them false. The object
on the horizon was a boat, a small craft like a
rowing skiff—at least, that was as well as they
could make out.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell Mr. Dancer?”</p>

<p>The question came from Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes; do so at once. It may be some shipwrecked
sailor adrift. At any rate, we ought to
look into it.”</p>

<p>Both Mr. Dancer and Mr. Chadwick agreed
with this. For the second time in forty-eight
hours the <i>White Shark</i> was diverted from her
course, and headed toward the drifting object.
As they drew closer it became evident enough,
however, that the boat was empty, or at least if
it had an occupant that he was past sitting up.</p>

<p>“May be some poor fellow overcome by the
heat and thirst,” suggested Mr. Dancer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> “We’d
better take a closer look.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the <i>White Shark</i> was run right
up alongside the drifting boat. As they drew
near, all hands held their breaths. They did not
know upon what tragedy of the ocean they might
be going to stumble. But the boat—a small white
one, like a ship’s dinghy—was empty. Nor did it
bear any evidence of having been occupied recently.</p>

<p>Above the stern seat was a name board, “Mary
Gloster, Liverpool.” Except for a coil of rope
and some fishing lines, there was nothing to show
where the boat came from or what she had been
last used for. The fishing lines gave a clew, however.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s been fishing and got adrift and
been picked up by a passing vessel which did not
bother to load on the dinghy,” said Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“That looks reasonable,” agreed Mr. Dancer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
“At any rate, we’ve done all we can do and time
is precious.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we tow it?” asked Tom. “It’s a dandy
little boat, and it seems a shame to leave it behind.”</p>

<p>“It does; but how can a submarine tow a boat
except to Davy Jones’ locker?” laughed Mr.
Chadwick quizzically.</p>

<p>“Well, hold this rope till I get into it and examine
it for more clews,” said Tom, who loved a
mystery and scented one here.</p>

<p>“Very well, Master Tom, Jack can make the
boat fast to the rail, but when the engines start
you’ll have to come on board.”</p>

<p>Tom nodded and jumped into the boat which
was bumping alongside. He threw the line in its
bow to Jack, who made it fast around the submarine’s
deck rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>“Go ahead, old Sherlock Holmes,” he grinned,
“get a clew.”</p>

<p>“All right. I might find a bag of gold,” retorted
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes; and you might find a bag of cookies, but
you won’t.”</p>

<p>Back and forth flew the raillery, but Tom patiently
dug around the floor of the drifting boat,
in which, to make it more odd, were a pair of
oars.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s just a mystery of the sea,” he said
at length, “and wow! this sun’s hot. I’ll come on
board and get a drink of water. I’m dying of
thirst.”</p>

<p>“Well, your enthusiasm soon petered out,”
scoffed Jack.</p>

<p>“Wish we could go fishing, though. That’s a
dandy boat for that. Wouldn’t you like to?”</p>

<p>“Like to what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>“Go fishing, of course,” responded Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Dancer’s head appeared above the hatchway.</p>

<p>“Go fishing, eh? Well, you can if you like.
Something’s wrong with the reverse gear. It
may take some time to find the trouble and
fix it.”</p>

<p>“Do you want help?” asked Tom, hoping the
answer would be in the negative.</p>

<p>“No, thank you. You boys go on and see if
you can’t catch a mess of nice fresh red snapper
for dinner. It will make a pleasant change.”</p>

<p>Tom flew below to get some stale meat from
Jupe for bait, and broad shady hats for himself
and Jack.</p>

<p>He was radiant when he reappeared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>
<p>“Hurray, Jack, we’ll have a regular picnic.
See, I got Jupe to fix us up a lunch, and here’s a
jug of water. We might get thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far,” warned Mr. Chadwick,
who had come on deck to see the fishing expedition
off.</p>

<p>“No danger of that. We’ll be within call.
Blow the whistle if you want us.”</p>

<p>Jack referred to the compressed air whistle
within the hatch. Its tone was loud and carried
far, and it was designed to be used when the
<i>White Shark</i> was going through crowded waters
on the surface.</p>

<p>“All right, three blasts will be the signal that
we are ready.”</p>

<p>“All right, dad. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye. Careful now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure we will; it’s like a lake this morning.”</p>

<p>With Jack at the oars the boys rowed around
a bit and dropped their lines over from time to
time with fair success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ve not got the right kind of bait,
Tom,” declared Jack at length; “they don’t seem
to be biting right.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s pull around a bit and then try our
luck again.”</p>

<p>“All right. You do the pulling, though. It’s
too warm for one chap to do all the work.”</p>

<p>“Rowing’s my middle name; give me the oars.”</p>

<p>“Here they are. Don’t fall overboard in
changing seats. I fancy I saw a shark’s fin
cruising round here.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ll show you how to row.”</p>

<p>Tom bent to the oars and pulled with a will.
The small boat cut over the water merrily.</p>

<p>After a while Tom paused. They looked about
them.</p>

<p>“My, Tom, we’re a long way from the <i>White
Shark</i>,” exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>
<p>“Well, didn’t I tell you I was a strong rower?
I must have pulled your lazy anatomy a good four
miles.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s try fishing. If they signal us we
can hear it from here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure. Come on; bet you I get the first
fish.”</p>

<p>“Bet you a doughnut you don’t. Ah, see
there!”</p>

<p>Tom drew aboard a fine red snapper. It lay
flapping in the bottom of the boat, its bright
golden scales glinting, while the boys gazed at it
admiringly.</p>

<p>And all the time a danger they never dreamed
of was sweeping down on them like a thief in the
night, silent and unseen.</p>

<small>LOST IN THE FOG.</small></h2>


<p>After that, the fish bit fast and furiously. It
seemed that the boys had nothing to do but to
bait their hooks, throw them over and pull in a
fish. There were all varieties, many of them
strange to the two lads. Suddenly Tom’s hook
was seized by something that gave a tug that almost
pulled the boy out of the boat into the water.</p>

<p>“Wow!” yelled Tom. “I’ve got a whale!”</p>

<p>He twisted his line about a thwart, for whatever
had caught the other end of the line almost
pulled his arms out when he attempted to hold it
unaided.</p>

<p>“You mean the whale’s got you,” shouted
Jack, laughing.</p>

<p>But the next instant his laughter turned to a
shout of dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>“Your whale’s running away with us.”</p>

<p>This was true. The creature that had hold of
Tom’s line was darting off at a rapid rate and
pulling the boat behind him.</p>

<p>They skimmed over the water at great speed,
Tom enjoying the fun hugely.</p>

<p>“This beats motor boating,” he declared, “no
engine to bother with and just as fast. Guess I’ll
catch this critter when he gets tired out and introduce
him at home as a new form of motive
power.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort, Tom. Cast him
off. Here’s my knife. Cut the line.”</p>

<p>“Why? Let’s go on a bit further,” begged
Tom.</p>

<p>“It would be all right if your fish motor would
tow us toward the <i>White Shark</i>, but look back
there!”</p>

<p>Tom turned and saw the <i>White Shark</i> terribly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
far off. He thought of the long pull back to her,
and his muscles fairly ached in anticipation.
Hesitating no longer, he took Jack’s proffered
knife and slashed the line. As he did so, a few
yards ahead a huge barracuda gave a leap into
the air, landing back with a mighty splash and
darting off at a mile-a-minute gait.</p>

<p>“There, that’s what gave us a tow away out
here,” declared Tom, as the huge fish, which
must have weighed two or three hundred pounds,
vanished. “Wouldn’t it have been great if we
could have induced him to turn round and tow us
back to the <i>White Shark</i>? I’d have begged him a
bucketful of bait for the kindness.”</p>

<p>“Well, quit talking rot and pick up the oars,”
admonished Jack.</p>

<p>He had been looking about him and noticing a
curious effect in the atmosphere. A sort of filmy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
haze had grown up between them and the <i>White
Shark</i>, almost obscuring the latter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus-238.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HESITATING NO LONGER—HE SLASHED THE LINE.</div>
</div>

<p>Tom picked up the oars, grumbling as he did
so.</p>

<p>“Huh! I wish we’d never made fast to that
fish.”</p>

<p>“I told you to cut loose sooner,” rejoined Jack;
“just for that you’ll do some extra pulling.”</p>

<p>Under what sailors term an “ash breeze”—namely,
the power of a pair of oars—the boat
moved but slowly.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that we are going twice as
slow as when we came out,” muttered Tom, the
perspiration pouring down his face from his exertions.</p>

<p>“It does seem so,” agreed Jack; “maybe there
is some sort of ocean current hereabouts.”</p>

<p>After that there was silence for a time. Tom
pulled steadily while Jack looked about him at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
weather. The odd mist or haze he had noticed
had grown thicker. Presently the whole sea began
to steam. It was as if the water was boiling
and giving off great clouds of vapor.</p>

<p>“Crickets!” cried Jack anxiously. “We’re in
for it now, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up? They’ll wait for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we can find them. Look about you.”</p>

<p>Tom gave over rowing for a time and looked
up.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” he exclaimed in dismay. “Fog!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what it is, all right.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re lost!”</p>

<p>Tom’s voice was quavery with sudden alarm,
but Jack kept a steady head.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get rattled,” he admonished.
“Keep cool, just as you would if you were lost in
the woods.”</p>

<p>The haze grew momentarily thicker. In white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
wraith-like folds it encompassed them, beating in
softly all about them, like the waves of a vaporous
sea.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” mused Jack, “the <i>White Shark</i> lay
off that way, didn’t she, when we saw her last?”</p>

<p>He pointed out into the steamy white smother.</p>

<p>“But are you sure she did?” asked Tom, whose
pluck was coming back now that the first shock
was over.</p>

<p>“Almost certain. At any rate, we’ll pull in
that direction. Give me one oar and you take the
other; we shall get along faster so.”</p>

<p>With one boy at each oar the boat did get
through the mist faster. They pulled till they
were fairly exhausted, but at last Jack paused.</p>

<p>“If we are coming in the right direction the
<i>White Shark</i> must be close at hand now,” he declared.
“Let’s try shouting.”</p>

<p>The boys yelled and shouted with full lung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
power, but no answering shout came back out of
the mist. At last they were compelled to give in.
Their throats were raw and cracked from their
vocal exercise.</p>

<p>They exchanged blank looks.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Tom flatly.</p>

<p>“There’s no use blinking the fact, Tom,” was
Jack’s rejoinder, “we are lost.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we do anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except make the best of it, like the
Indian who was found wandering about by a
party of hunters. ‘Are you lost?’ they asked him.
‘No,’ replied the noble red man, ‘me not lost,
wigwam lost.’ That’s about the way we’ve got
to look at our situation, Tom, old boy.”</p>

<p>Jack tried hard to make his voice cheerful and
confident, but somehow Tom did not smile at his
companion’s story. And all about them the fog
shut in ever closer and closer.</p>

<small>“A PHANTOM OF LIGHT.”</small></h2>


<p>For a long time Jack tried to keep Tom’s spirits
up by joking and laughing. But jokes in a situation
like the one that encompassed the two boys
are but sorry things, and at length Jack gave
over.</p>

<p>“Is there anything we can do?” asked Tom
mournfully.</p>

<p>“We might cut holes in the fog and climb to
the top,” laughed Jack, and then more seriously
he continued: “I don’t know what there is to
do, Tom, old boy, except to wait. ‘Wait till the
clouds roll by, Nellie,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“That may not be for days.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s discuss that. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well. But I think we had better go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
easy on what food we have; we may need it before
long.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll put off the lunch part of it,
then. But I must have some water; I’m awfully
dry after that row.”</p>

<p>“So am I; but we must be careful of the water,
too.”</p>

<p>The boys each took a sparing drink from the
stone bottle, letting the water first moisten their
mouths and then trickle down their parched
throats. This done they looked about them once
more. But if they had expected to discern a
single ray of hope, they were disappointed. The
fog was as dense as ever, denser, if anything.
The outlook, to say the least of it, was not encouraging.</p>

<p>Hour after hour wore on thus. During the
afternoon they ate sparingly, and took turns lying
in the bottom of the boat and taking a nap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
At last darkness shut down on them, and then
they began to be really panic-stricken.</p>

<p>Not a sound had come to them out of the fog,
and, for all they knew, they might be miles from
the <i>White Shark</i>. The ocean was full of currents
thereabouts; that, Jack knew full well. Possibly
they had been caught in one of those and were
being carried farther and farther from their
friends. At any rate, it seemed certain that if
they were anywhere near the submarine they
would have heard the sound of the whistle; for
Jack knew that those on board that craft must
be worried half distraught by the nonappearance
of the young fishermen.</p>

<p>“I wish this old boat had been at the bottom
of the sea before we ever found her,” muttered
Tom disconsolately.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>
<p>“So do I. But wishing will do no good. It’s
action that counts in this world.”</p>

<p>“Of course; but how are you going to get action
when there is no field for it?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Tom; but waiting about like
this, not knowing what’s going to become of us,
or even being able to see a foot ahead, is tough.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what they are doing on board now?”</p>

<p>Tom’s words brought up a vision of the snug
cabin of the submarine with all its comforts, and
the table spread with Jupe’s excellent cooking.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” groaned Jack, “don’t make me think
of it. They must be terribly worried, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I wish their worry would bring them to find
us,” rejoined Tom; “but, of course, they couldn’t
do that in this mess. It’s a regular game of
blindman’s buff.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we are <i>it</i>, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>The night wore on. It was deathly silent there
in the dense fog. In the pauses of the conversation
they bravely tried to keep up, they could hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
the lapping of the little waves against the side of
the boat. This made Jack think what a good
thing it was that a gale had not sprung up instead
of a fog. In such case, their position would
have been even worse.</p>

<p>All at once, far off in the fog, came a peculiar
sound—a throbbing like the beating of some titanic
heart.</p>

<p>“A steamer!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>This suggested a fresh peril. In the fog they
might be run down by the unseen ship. Clearly,
judging by the increasing sound of the throbbing
propeller, she was coming toward them.</p>

<p>“We must get out of her path!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course; but how are we to tell just where
she is, in this fog? I can’t locate sound at all.”</p>

<p>“No more can I. I only wish it was possible
to attract her attention in some way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>“Why? I don’t see that that would do us much
good. We could get out of her way quicker than
she could out of ours.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but she might pick us up.”</p>

<p>“What good would that do? You couldn’t expect
them to heave to and go hunting for the
<i>White Shark</i>, especially if she is a mail boat.
The best she could do would be to land us in some
port, and—— G-g-g-great S-s-cott, Tom, <i>pull
for your life</i>!”</p>

<p>Both boys snatched up the oars and pulled for
all they were worth, digging the oar blades deep
into the water.</p>

<p>A spot of light loomed up through the fog.
A huge bow towered blackly above them. With
the sweat starting from every pore, the boys
pulled frantically. They just managed to avoid
the vessel which, like a ghost, glided past in the
smother. Bright beams came from her portholes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
and she seemed like a phantom of light as she
swept by.</p>

<p>For a minute she shone glitteringly through the
mist, and then was gone as quickly as she had appeared.
Through the fog came the sound of
music and laughter. She was a passenger ship,
and there was a gay dance going forward on
board. But not one of the dancers so much as
dreamed that they had passed almost within a
handshake of two lost and miserable boys, adrift
on the broad Atlantic in a cockleshell of an open
boat.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>LAND IS SIGHTED.</small></h2>


<p>The vanishing of the steamer for some reason
left with the boys a feeling of blankness and
loneliness that had not, with all their distress,
been there before.</p>

<p>“Just think of everybody on board that steamer
having a good time, and here we are so close to
them and so wretched,” grumbled Tom.</p>

<p>“Getting sore about it won’t make things any
better, Tom,” admonished Jack. “Let’s be
cheerful.”</p>

<p>“Cheerful? Huh!”</p>

<p>“Well, try to be as cheerful as we can, then.
Getting in the dumps about it won’t help matters
any.”</p>

<p>But Tom sat silently in the stern of the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
until he grew so sleepy that Jack told him to lie
down and cover himself with the sail and take a
nap.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when to relieve guard,” he said.</p>

<p>Tom looked ashamed of himself. Jack’s tenderness
touched him and made him realize how
cross and selfish he had been, while Jack was trying
to bear up amidst their troubles.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Jack,” he said contritely, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>That was all, but Jack understood and clasped
the proffered hand warmly.</p>

<p>“Now lie down, old chap, and get some sleep.
Let’s hope that by the time you wake up things
will have improved.”</p>

<p>Tom crawled under the canvas of the sail and
in a jiffy was off in dreamland. It appeared to be
not more than ten minutes later that he was
aroused by somebody throwing a bucket of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
over his head. At least that was the way it appeared
to Tom. He sat up angrily, not at first
realizing where he was.</p>

<p>He saw Jack regarding him amusedly. The
fog had gone and in its place a brisk breeze blew,
whipping the sea into small waves. One of these
had just broken in spray against the bow and
given Tom his morning bath in such an unceremonious
manner.</p>

<p>“Any sign?” asked Tom, as he saw what appeared
to be a look of hope on Jack’s face.</p>

<p>“No, not a sign,” rejoined Jack, understanding
without further words just what Tom meant.</p>

<p>“But you look sort of—sort of——”</p>

<p>“Cheered up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. What makes you so?”</p>

<p>By way of rejoinder Jack ordered Tom to “look
there,” pointing off over the port bow of the
dancing cockleshell. Tom followed the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of Jack’s finger with his eyes. He saw, as the
boat rose on the crest of a wave, a small patch
that appeared to be a cloud of a delicate purple
hue.</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” he inquired, not seeing
much interest in a cloud.</p>

<p>“That’s land over yonder; I’m sure of it,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p>“What sort of land?” Tom appeared skeptical.</p>

<p>“Why, an island, of course. One of the Bahamas,
I imagine. We’re about in that latitude.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the island a minute; just where
are we, and where’s the <i>White Shark</i>?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to say ‘don’t know’ to both questions.
I’ve no more idea than you have.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t row during the night, and we
can’t have been so awfully far from her. In that
case, why is it that we see no sign of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>“My theory is that we got caught in one of the
ocean currents—may be in it yet—and were
dragged from the vicinity of the submarine during
the night. Then, too, we may have rowed in
the wrong direction last night when first we discovered
that we were lost.”</p>

<p>“That being the case, I don’t see what you have
to look cheerful over.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? Well, I do. Suppose that’s an
island over yonder. We can get up the sail and
be there in a few hours.”</p>

<p>“What will we find when we get there? Sand
and monkeys, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“There are no monkeys in the Bahamas, Tom,
and so far as the island being a barren one is concerned,
we shall have to take our chance on
that.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s worth trying, anyhow. We might
as well do that as toss about out here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>“Let’s hoist the sail then.”</p>

<p>This was quickly done, the canvas being of the
leg-o’-mutton variety. Under the small sheet the
little boat flew skimmingly over the waves.</p>

<p>Had the circumstances been different, the boys
would have thoroughly enjoyed the exhilarating
sport. But in their case, it was more business
than sport that occupied their thoughts. If the
distant speck which Jack believed was an island
should prove to be an uninhabited one, their position
would be about as bad as bad could be. They
ate their last provisions for breakfast, and a
sorry meal it made, and drank almost the last
of their precious water, only leaving a small
quantity for emergencies.</p>

<p>As they flew along it soon became evident that
Jack’s surmise was a correct one. The distant
land was an island, and upon it was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
that at first puzzled them. This was what looked
like a tall, leafless tree.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is?” murmured Tom as they
gazed at it.</p>

<p>“A royal palm, perhaps, with its top blown off
in the last hurricane,” hazarded Jack.</p>

<p>But Tom suddenly burst into a joyous exclamation.</p>

<p>“Royal palm, nothing, Jack! It’s—it’s a lighthouse!”</p>

<p>“Hurray! Then the island <i>is</i> inhabited, and
we are all right!” cried Jack, his relief showing in
his glowing face.</p>

<p>“Hold on. Don’t go too fast,” counseled Tom,
“we’re not there yet, you know.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to his words, at almost the
same instant a big wave flopped over the bow of
the boat. Jack, who was steering, had let the
craft veer to a little, not being very skillful at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
steering with an oar, which he had to use, there
being no rudder in the boat.</p>

<p>“Jiminy! Do you want to sink us?” remonstrated
Tom, starting to bale out the water with
the tin can in which they had brought their bait.
This kept him busy so long that he had not much
time to notice his surroundings, but presently,
raising his head above the bulwarks, he was
alarmed to see that the sea had increased in violence
till it was really rough. The wind, too, was
freshening and blowing harder every minute.</p>

<p>The boat was riding the big rolling seas like a
duck, and Jack was handling her with real skill,
but at any moment he might let the little craft
fall off and then there was every chance of a big
sea boarding and swamping her.</p>

<p>“Goodness, we seem to get out of one trouble
only to tumble into another,” exclaimed Tom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
“Easy there!”</p>

<p>A shower of spray flew high over the small
boat, drenching its occupants to the skin.</p>

<p>“This would be all right sailing near home,”
said Jack, shaking the water out of his curls, “but
right now it strikes me that we could do with a
little less sea.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she’ll last till we get to land?”
asked Tom uneasily.</p>

<p>“If it doesn’t blow any harder, we ought to do
all right.”</p>

<p>“But if not?”</p>

<p>“Then we are going to have a pretty tough time
in making port.”</p>

<p>For an interval after that, neither of them
spoke. It took all Jack’s skill to handle the boat,
while Tom kept his eyes riveted on the island
which every moment grew more distinct in outline.</p>

<p>You are not to think, though, that the boy could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
gaze continuously at the island. At times the
boat would plunge down into a watery valley
from which it seemed impossible she could ever
rise. Again, topping a wave crest, Tom was able
to view the island for a flash.</p>

<p>It was a low, sandy islet with a few stunted
wind-blown palms at one end. At the other stood
the lighthouse—a tall, thin tower painted in broad
red and white bands alternately.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>A SINGLE CHANCE.</small></h2>


<p>The sea grew rougher as the wind freshened,
just as Jack had feared it would. The little boat
fairly flew along now, at times almost burying
her lee gunwale. It was at such moments that
Jack showed his skill as a sailor. One fraction of
a mistake in his handling of the small craft and
she would have keeled over a particle of an inch
too far and filled up.</p>

<p>But with a closer view of the island a disconcerting
fact was discovered. There appeared to
be no place to land. The surf could be seen in
great white clouds rising from the white beach,
on which the big rollers crashed with a noise like
thunder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>
<p>“How in the world are we going to land
there?” Tom asked in dismay, gazing at the surf
as it was tossed ten feet into the air. The thunder
and roar of it could be plainly heard.</p>

<p>“We’d be smashed up in a second in those
rollers,” declared Jack. “We must find some
other landing place, that’s all.”</p>

<p>At the risk of swamping the boat, he headed
her on a course that would carry them around
the lighthouse end of the island. Flying along,
half buried in foam, the little craft made good
weather of it. But they now had a beam sea, and
she was more difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from a small tin-roofed house that
nestled under the tall lighthouse, a man came running
at top speed. He had seen the boat and now
shouted something, pointing to the other side of
the island. Jack rightly guessed that he meant
that there was a harbor on that side.</p>

<p>Hurling spray high over her, the little boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
dashed around the end of the islet. On the other
side the sea was just as high, but a sort of reef
ran out at one point, behind which natural breakwater
lay the harbor of which the lighthouse
keeper had tried to tell them.</p>

<p>The waves broke on the reef with terrific violence,
and at first Jack looked in vain for an opening.
At last, however, he saw one. But it looked
terribly narrow. To get through it he would
have to run his boat almost in the shadow of the
big breakers, any one of which would have
smashed boys and boat like eggshells. Yet he
knew that he must make that opening to reach the
smooth water beyond.</p>

<p>Luffing up, he went about on another tack. In
his eagerness he stood half upright in the stern,
crouching forward above his steering oar, guiding
the plunging boat as a skilled horseman controls
a restive animal. Tom, who was huddled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the bottom of the boat so as to give her more
stability, saw the opening. He glanced back at
Jack with a look that said:</p>

<p>“Dare we chance it?”</p>

<p>Jack’s lips were set in a grim line. His muscles
stood out like whipcords on his arms. The wind
blew back his curls above his high forehead. He
was a picture of strong, confident, American
youth. But in reality there was in his heart anything
but confidence that he could make that
opening. It could not have been more than
twelve feet or so across, and on either side the
cruel fangs of the reef showed when the rollers
broke over them.</p>

<p>On flew the boat like a runaway horse with
the bit in its teeth. But Jack had her under perfect
control. Twice he tacked; once, in executing
the maneuver, he almost swamped his small craft.
But she recovered and once more headed up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
that pitifully small opening between the teeth of
the reef.</p>

<p>This time Jack did not tack. Gripping his
steering oar with one hand, and the sheet rope of
the sail with the other, he made straight for the
opening. Grimly he told himself that he must
force the boat through. It was that or the alternative
of being pounded to death on the reef.</p>

<p>And now the opening was quite close. With
fascinated eyes and beating heart Tom gazed at
it and then stole a backward look at Jack. The
figure he saw gave him confidence that, come
what might, Jack would not lose his nerve in a
situation where the slightest hesitancy might
mean death for both of them.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant the reef was on
them. Tom almost uttered a cry as he saw the
boat headed for what appeared to mean annihilation.
But with a quick, skillful twist of his oar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Jack headed her off, and like an arrow she shot
for the opening.</p>

<p>As she flew through it, Tom could have reached
out and touched the reef with his left hand, by so
close a margin of safety did they gain entrance.
But the daring trip was made in surety, and the
next instant the reefs were thundering behind
them and they were skimming over calm water
inside the natural breakwater, formed by the
outer rim of rocks.</p>

<p>“I never thought you could do it, Jack,” exclaimed
Tom, fixing admiring eyes on his chum.
“It was the cleverest bit of boat handling I’ve
ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t so very hard,” rejoined Jack
modestly; “it was getting on a tack that would
bring me flying through, that was the hard part.”</p>

<p>“I was scared stiff, I can tell you. I thought
sure we’d be battered to a pulp on those rocks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>“All the more credit to you for not making a
holler. Luckily I had too much to do to think of
getting scared. But it’s all over now, and I’m
not a bit sorry, I can tell you. All the skin is off
my hands. But—— Hullo! there comes the
lightkeeper down to meet us.”</p>

<p>The same man whom they had seen run out on
the beach was now coming down to a sort of
rough wharf which stretched out into the lagoon.
He was a tall chap, thin and lanky, with an unhealthy-looking
complexion. As they drew closer
they saw that his face was streaked with shadows
and drawn in tense lines. His eyes were sunken
and blurred. Apparently he was not far off from
a breakdown.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m glad you’ve come!” he exclaimed
in a voice that was half hysterical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> “My partner
has been gone for more than two days! I guess
that fog delayed him getting back, and the light’s
gone bad—she’s gone bad. Last night she
wouldn’t shine, and there are big reefs that
stretch out for miles that her light warns of.”</p>

<p>The boys tied the boat and climbed up a flight
of rough steps to reach the surface of the wharf.
The man greeted them with open hands.</p>

<p>“I should have gone crazy if you had not
come!” he exclaimed. “I should have gone
crazy!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the light?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The boss is the mechanic. He
could have fixed it, but he went away on the supply
ship. He should have been back last night,
but he didn’t come. Oh, I have had a terrible
night!”</p>

<p>“Surely something can be done,” said Tom,
really distressed by the man’s excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. I can’t tell what is the matter,”
was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Well, I have some little mechanical skill,” replied
Jack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> “Suppose we go up to your house and
have some breakfast, of which you seem to be in
need and we certainly are, and then I and my
cousin, Tom Jesson here, will go to work on your
light.”</p>

<small>A FORTUNATE FIND.</small></h2>


<p>The lighthouse keeper’s hut was well furnished
and provisioned, and they partook of a good meal.
While they ate, enjoying to the full the hot coffee
and crisp bacon with which their host served
them, they listened to his tale of his life.</p>

<p>He had been an orange grower in Florida, but
a frost had wiped out all his plantation in a single
night. A ruined man, he was compelled to seek
any sort of employment, and through a friend
had secured a position as assistant keeper at this
lonely lighthouse. The name of the island on
which the boys had landed was Nacassa, and it
was one of the most easterly of the Bahama
group.</p>

<p>The light had been placed on Nacassa by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
British government, to whom all the Bahama
Islands belong, to warn ships of the dread Nacassa
reefs, which, it appeared, were once celebrated
for the annual harvest of wrecked ships
they gathered in.</p>

<p>By the time the keeper had concluded his story
the boys had finished eating, and Jack declared
that he was ready to see if he could find out what
ailed the light.</p>

<p>They entered the tower by a small door and began
climbing winding stairs that coiled round and
round inside the narrow limits of the lighthouse.
At last they reached the top. The light was run
by a clockwork mechanism, which, in its turn, was
operated by weights which were drawn to the top
of the tower every day. It was their gradual descent
during the night that made the clockwork
run and the light revolve.</p>

<p>Jack examined the machinery with interest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
He wound up the weights and carefully listened
to the “click-click” of the mechanism as they descended.
He was puzzled to locate what was
wrong for a while, but at last he found it. Like
most such troubles it was a very small one, which
was just what made it so hard to find.</p>

<p>A screw head had worked loose and allowed a
cogwheel to shift. This is what had caused the
whole trouble. With a screwdriver and a new
screw Jack soon had the mechanism running as
well as ever.</p>

<p>“And so that’s all that was the matter with it,”
cried the man of the tower. “Why, I could have
fixed that myself, and I don’t know a monkey-wrench
from a handsaw. I guess, though, it’s
like Columbus’s egg trick—easy when you know
how, and blamed hard when you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s it,” said Jack, with an enigmatic
smile. He knew, but didn’t say so, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
only long experience and a deft hand for mechanics
had enabled him to locate the trouble at
all, it was such a very obscure one.</p>

<p>“At any rate, I’m ever so grateful to you lads,”
the man said fervently. “How to thank you,
though, I don’t just know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Jack. “The best
way you could repay for any help we have been
fortunate enough to give you, would be to tell us
some way to find our friends.”</p>

<p>The man puckered his brow in thought. The
boys had told him their story, and he was really
anxious to help them. What with Jack’s mechanical
skill and his clever handling of the boat, the
assistant keeper’s admiration for the lad was tremendous.</p>

<p>“Tell you what,”, began the keeper suddenly,
but he broke off abruptly again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>“No, that wouldn’t do, either,” he concluded,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“What wouldn’t do?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ll try anything, however impossible it
seems,” struck in Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, but neither of you kids could work
wireless?” demanded the man.</p>

<p>“Wireless! Why, that’s my middle name.
Have you got one on the island?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Dick Fennell, that’s my mate, he installed
one by way of amusing himself. I don’t
know how good he is at it, but he’s got a likely
looking set of doo-dads and things.”</p>

<p>The boys could hardly keep from bounding
down the spiral stairway three steps at a time.</p>

<p>“Here’s a bit of luck,” exclaimed Jack, “if only
that wireless is working we may be able to get
into communication with the <i>White Shark</i>.”</p>

<p>Yes, if she’s on the surface,” rejoined Tom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
who, as has been seen, was somewhat of a pessimist.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s sure to be,” rejoined Jack, “I’ll bet
they’re cruising about looking for us now. By
the way,” he broke off, addressing the lightkeeper,
“is there any sort of an ocean current that
sets toward this island?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s the Great Bahama current that
would land you here if you drifted from the
northward.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon it then, Tom, it was just as I
thought, a current that separated us from our
friends,” said Jack as they descended the stairs
<i>en route</i> for the wireless plant of the senior
lightkeeper.</p>

<p>It was odd that they had not observed the web-like
aërials before, for now that Zeb Carter, the
assistant, pointed them out, they were plain
enough, stretched between the lighthouse itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
and a dead palm tree. The room which housed
the instruments was more of a rough shed than
anything else, and was roofed with palm leaves.</p>

<p>Carter pulled a rubber cloth, designed to keep
the instruments from moisture, off the table that
held them. The boys regarded the set approvingly.
It was a powerful one of the latest type.
Evidently Fennell had not stinted himself on the
price of his hobby.</p>

<p>Power was furnished from a dynamo run by
a small gasoline engine. Fennell, so Carter said,
had complained of trouble with this engine. Before
starting it, therefore, Jack looked it over.
He soon located the trouble—in the timer—and
adjusted it. Then he started the engine. Soon
the dynamo began to buzz loudly.</p>

<p>“Now then, I guess we’re all ready,” said Jack.</p>

<p>He sat himself down at the sending lever, first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
setting the switch, and then began sending out the
submarine’s secret call.</p>

<p>“<i>W-S! W-S! W-S!</i>”</p>

<p>The spark crackled and blazed as it leaped
across its terminals, but that was the only sound
in the place except the distant roar of the surf.
Again and again, for half an hour or more, Jack
continued to call, stopping every now and then to
adjust his receiver and listen for a reply.</p>

<p>Once he caught an answer, but it was only a
steamer on her way to the West Indies.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack gave a cry of triumph.</p>

<p>“What a double-dyed idiot I am!” he exclaimed.
“I haven’t even had the sense to adjust
this instrument to the same wave lengths as those
of the <i>White Shark’s</i> set!”</p>

<p>Bending forward, he quickly made the necessary
adjustments in the condenser. Then once
more he sent the call vibrating into the caverns
of space.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>A FISH STORY.</small></h2>


<p>Then came the same breathless pause for an
answer. But this time the suspense was not regardless.
To Jack’s ears came a tiny ticking in
reply.</p>

<p>“<i>Who wants the WHITE SHARK?</i>”</p>

<p>Jack uttered a yell which apprised the others
that he had at last caught the connection he was
after. The boy’s hands flew as he switched to
the sending key.</p>

<p>“<i>Jack Chadwick and Tom Jesson. Who is
this?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Your father</i>,” came flashing back through
space the next instant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> “<i>Good heavens, boy, we
had given you up for lost. Where are you?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t just know, right now</i>,” flashed back
Jack; “<i>will tell you in a second.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Where have you been?</i>” came crackling back
impatiently. “<i>We have passed a dreadful night
of anxiety.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>It’s too long a story now. I will tell it to you
when we meet. Is the engine fixed?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Yes; it was mended just after that fog shut
down. We didn’t miss you till then.</i>”</p>

<p>Jack turned to the lighthouse keeper.</p>

<p>“What latitude and longitude is this island
in?” he asked.</p>

<p>“27° 31’ N. by 79° 5’ W.“</p>

<p>The reply was written on a scrap of paper and
handed to Jack. He flashed it over the waves of
space to the operator so anxiously waiting in the
cabin of the submarine.</p>

<p>”<i>Why, you are not more than a hundred miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
from us</i>,“ came the reply; ”<i>we’ll come there at top
speed.</i>”</p>

<p>“Tell him the harbor is on the southeast side
of the island,” prompted Tom.</p>

<p>“<i>The harbor is on the southeast side of the
island</i>,” flashed Jack. “<i>Anchor off there and we
will come out to you.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Very good, my boy. Thank heaven, we have
found you</i>,” was Mr. Chadwick’s fervent reply.
Then; came the good-bye and the keys were
closed; but the boys had a vivid mental picture of
the scene on the <i>White Shark</i>. How the engines
would be relentlessly driven in an effort to break
a record to reach Nacassa Island!</p>

<p>“It ought to take them about four hours to get
here,” Jack figured.</p>

<p>“I can hardly wait till they arrive,” said Tom
impatiently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> “I wish I had something to occupy
my time to keep my mind off the waiting.”</p>

<p>“Try fishing,” suggested Carter.</p>

<p>Both boys broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve had enough fishing to last us a
hundred years,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go as far as that,” rejoined Jack;
“but I guess we’ve had a sufficiency for a while.
As the Dutchman said, ’Too much is enough.’”</p>

<p>“I had a great experience out here with a big
fish,” said the lightkeeper.</p>

<p>The boys saw at once that a story was coming,
and as it would help pass the time they settled
back to listen. They were sitting in deck chairs
just within the shadow of the little hut.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that it will interest you, but it
will pass the time anyhow,” said Carter, “so here
goes:</p>

<p>“Well, I was fishing off that wharf, the one
you just landed at, when I saw the biggest bar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>racuda
I had ever seen. He was all of eight feet
long—the dictionary tells of ’em being twelve—thick
as a telegraph pole and as steely looking
as a big torpedo.</p>

<p>“‘Good land,’ thinks I, ‘if I could only land
that fish and have him mounted, he’d sell for a
good figure to some of those inter-tourists who
come to Florida to go back with big fish stories.’
To tell the story right, they have to take the fish
to prove it; and lots of fellows make a tidy living
selling big fish to big men who wouldn’t know
a barracuda from a porgie if they saw them in
an aquarium.</p>

<p>“Well, I starts in on my preparations to land
Mr. Barracuda. I saw him cock up a knowing
eye at me and then sink down, down, down out
of sight. But I knew somehow that he would
come back, and I just sat and waited. It was
funny to watch all the different kind of fish down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
in that water. First a flock of parrot fish, pink
and white striped like zebras, would float by.
Then come a striped shark, yellow and black, like
a tiger, with maybe a string of young sharks—‘puppies,’
they call ’em—following her.</p>

<p>“Next thing would be a big old devil fish, snapping
his beak, and then a school of small fry,
swimming for their lives to get away from some
barracuda. But, though while I waited I saw
a lot of barracuda, I didn’t see the one I called
mine.</p>

<p>“Well, I came there every day for a week, and
I tried every kind of bait I could think of, but
Old King Cole, as I had come to call the big fish,
was always absent on pressing business. It ran
along like this for maybe a month before I saw
him again. I ran hot foot to the shack. Got my
rod and two hundred yards of stout line. Then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
baited up with live bait and went after Old King
Cole.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he must have been hungry, for he
took my bait like a flash, and then the fight began.
Gracious, how that fish fought! Just when
I thought I had him tired out, he’d start again.
But the funny thing was that the harder I’d fight
him the livelier he seemed to get. Finally I yelled
to Dick, who was up by the light, to get me a revolver
quick.</p>

<p>“‘What you got there?’ he hollers.</p>

<p>“‘The biggest fish in the world; and if I don’t
get him he’ll get me, by thunder!’ I yells back.</p>

<p>“Dick he came on the run with that gun.</p>

<p>“I told him to watch and I’d play the fish near
the surface. Well, I gave him line and then,
Ginger! on he came like a locomotive. ‘Now!’
yells I, and Dick fired. Again I called, and Dick
let him have two more. The weight on the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
grew dead all of a sudden and the water turned
crimson. When it cleared I looked down into it
and could hardly believe my eyes. There, in the
shallow water, lay dead a fish three times the size
of my barracuda! At first I couldn’t realize that
it was a dead shark lying there, I was so astonished.</p>

<p>“‘All that trouble over a shark!’ grumbles
Dick.</p>

<p>“‘I tell you I hooked a barracuda,’ I protested.</p>

<p>“Dick gave me a queer look. But we rigged a
block and tackle and got the shark out. Well, sir,
what do you think we found?”</p>

<p>The boys shook their heads.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>
<p>“That shark had swallowed my barracuda, and
the barracuda had stuck in his throat! We had
to cut him open to get my fish out, and then we
had a tussle to kill the barracuda. What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“That you’re wasting your time here,” grinned
Tom.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, you ought to be writing for one of the
outdoor magazines. They’d pay you big prices!”</p>

<small>FACING A SERIOUS SITUATION.</small></h2>


<p>“Cuba!”</p>

<p>The word came from Mr. Chadwick as, two
days after the events narrated in our last chapter,
the dim outline of a rugged coast came into view
from the deck of the <i>White Shark</i>. The submarine
had arrived on time at Nacassa, and the
boys, having witnessed the arrival of the supply
steamer with Fennel on board, had rowed out to
the diving boat.</p>

<p>But after all their adventures in her, they had
hated to part with the little boat in which they
had weathered such a terrific sea, and so, in response
to their earnest solicitations, the craft was
hoisted on board and lashed securely to the deck
ring bolts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>“Remember, if it is swept away when we dive,
don’t blame me,” said Mr. Dancer, and the boys
promised that they wouldn’t. Privately, though,
they thought it was secure against anything.</p>

<p>“How long before we come in sight of your
mine?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sonora is quite a way down the coast. I
don’t expect to sight it before this evening. By
the way, I cabled Jameson before we left that if
all was well he was to hoist a white light. If not,
two red ones.”</p>

<p>“You don’t anticipate any real trouble, do
you?” asked Mr. Dancer, who was taking an airing
on deck while Silas did a “trick” at the wheel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>
<p>“I don’t know. These rebels are inflamed
against Americans. They think that the Cuban
government grants them favors. Then, too, some
them have an idea that by destroying American
property they can force the intervention of
the United States.”</p>

<p>“So that is the case. In that event I suppose
things might prove to be serious. Is the Cuban
army a strong one?”</p>

<p>“It consists mostly of rurales, a sort of rough-and-ready
cavalry. But they have a few troops
of infantry.”</p>

<p>By lunch time, the bold and rugged outline of
Cape Maysoi, the eastern extremity of Cuba, was
visible. The coast here rises in barren, rocky terraces,
and Jack was able to tell the others that
these odd geological formations were caused by
the gradual receding of the sea as ages passed by.</p>

<p>All the afternoon they swept along the coast,
which was exceedingly lonely and barren. Only
a few cattle grazers’ huts could be seen as a sign
of human habitation, and the rugged, stark moun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>tains
that formed the background only enhanced
the sterile, wretched look of the grim coast.</p>

<p>One noteworthy sight was theirs when they
passed Guantanamo Bay, the rendezvous of Uncle
Sam’s fighting ships for battle practice every
winter.</p>

<p>“Well, they could shoot at that shore every day
and not hurt anything,” commented Jack.</p>

<p>Night had fallen when Mr. Chadwick declared
that they were in the vicinity of Sonora. The
chart showed plenty of water close into the coast,
and they crept in as near as they dared. The
mountains here towered precipitously up from the
sea. At their feet were many caves formed by
the ceaseless wash of the waves in the basal formations.</p>

<p>These caves exist all along that coast of Cuba,
and some of them are known to run many miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
underground. But nobody has ever fully explored
them.</p>

<p>Anxiety and suspense grew keen as they neared
Sonora. The cliffs rose blackly and forbiddingly
against the star-spattered sky, but as yet there
was no sign of a light ashore. Suddenly, from
the base of one of the cliffs, the expected signal
came. But it was not the white light that they
had hoped for,—the light that would have meant
that all was well.</p>

<p>Like two drops of blood on a black velvet curtain,
two scarlet lamps flamed out against the
dark background of the cliffs.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Mr. Chadwick,
“that means the worst. Jameson is not a man
who would get alarmed unnecessarily. Jupe, get
a red lamp from below and swing it to and fro
twice.”</p>

<p>“Y-y-y-yes, sah,” stuttered Jupe, who had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
great stomach for fighting. To him the mysterious
proceedings of the night seemed fraught with
direness also.</p>

<p>“H-h-h-ere you am, sah,” he stammered, coming
on deck and handing the lantern to Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“I told you to wave it, Jupe.”</p>

<p>“Y-y-y-y-yes, sah; but am you shuh dat wha’eber
dat contraption am asho’ ain’t a gwine ter
shoot jes’ as soon as ah wabe?”</p>

<p>“So you wouldn’t mind me being shot, eh?”
said Mr. Chadwick, smiling despite his very real
anxiety. “All right, Jupe, give it to me.”</p>

<p>The lantern was waved twice. The signal was
answered from shore.</p>

<p>“What now?” whispered Jack.</p>

<p>Somehow the impulse to speak in whispers was
almost irresistible. What with the darkness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
the night and the mystery of their errand, it
seemed that danger was lurking everywhere.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait here,” rejoined Mr. Chadwick;
“the mine is at the top of that cliff, a little bit
back from the edge. It is an old one worked
long ago by the Spaniards, and is as full of galleries
and passages as a rabbit warren. If those
rascally rebels once got into it, it would make a
fine hiding place for them.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Jameson going to row out?” asked
Jack, knowing that this was the only way by
which the superintendent could reach them.</p>

<p>“Yes; we keep a boat further down the coast.
See, he must have got out of the mine in some
way and reached the boat and then rowed to this
spot. He is a daring fellow.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now,” whispered Tom, pointing
to a red light which began to move over the
water toward them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>“Tut! He ought to have put that lantern out,”
exclaimed Mr. Chadwick. “Ah! I thought so!”</p>

<p>A red flash from the top of the cliff split the
night. A report followed and then the whole top
of the cliff blazed fire. The red light vanished,
but whether extinguished by a bullet, or by Jameson’s
hand, it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>“Confound it, the rascals keep a good lookout.
I hope they haven’t injured Jameson. He ought
to have had better sense than to leave that light
as a mark for them to aim at.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, however, anxiety for
Jameson was alleviated. A boat drew alongside
out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Jameson?” hailed Mr.
Chadwick anxiously.</p>

<p>“Aye, I’ll be bonny, thank ’ee, Mr. Chadwick,”
came a voice with a strong tinge of a burr in it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
“yon callants thocht they’d finish me the noo, but
they dinna ken James Jameson.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on board at once. You must have
much to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye,” rejoined Jameson, lifting his huge
bulk out of the boat. “I hae that; I hae that.”</p>

<p>He clambered on board, securing his boat. His
narrative was brief, but succinct. Two days before
the rebels had surrounded the mine and were
now encamped in great force outside the stockade.
Only ten men remained inside the stockade
on guard duty.</p>

<p>All the rest had deserted. Provisions were
running low, and a spring which supplied water
had, in some way, been cut off from the outside.</p>

<p>“I reckon the scallywags count on starving us
out,” concluded Mr. Jameson.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>
<p>“But how did you get out to reach the boat?
It was kept a mile up the coast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye. Well, I climbed over the stockade,
d’ye ken, and made me way to the bit boat wi’oot
trouble.”</p>

<p>Thus did Jameson describe what must have
been an act fraught with peril, for he had had to
pass through the rebel lines. Mr. Chadwick felt
this.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell us all, James Jameson,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Hoot, toot! I tole ye all. No use wasting
words, mon.”</p>

<p>“So that is the situation?” mused Mr. Chadwick.
“Well, that’s about as bad as it can be.
When do you think they will make the attack?”</p>

<p>“I dinna ken; but I think to-night. They ken
there is gold in the safe, for it would be pay day
the noo. But then they ken we hae a machine
gun, too, and they’re canny afraid of thot, I’m
thinkin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad of that. But where are the regulars?”</p>

<p>“There are some troops above Santiago, Mr.
Chadwick, but not enough to fight their way
through that boilin’ of rebels. The callants all
hae Remingtons, too, and some of the regular
troops haven’t even guns.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad. Then the men inside are penned
in without much hope of getting out alive unless
we bring relief.”</p>

<p>“That’s the situation in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>“But how is it going to be done?” asked Mr.
Chadwick with a trace of irritation in his voice
at the calmness of the Scot superintendent. “We
cannot leave those men in there to perish.”</p>

<p>“No, eets no to be thoct of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>“But the troops are not strong enough to cut
their way through the rebel ranks?”</p>

<p>“I’m no sayin’ they aren’t, and I’m no sayin’
they are.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Jameson, can’t you suggest
something except just to stand there and negative
suggestions?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ I’ve done some work to-night,
Mr. Chadwick,” was the dignified reply.</p>

<p>“You’re right, you have,” exclaimed Mr. Chadwick
contritely; “forgive me, Jameson, but I’m
overwrought and nervous. But can’t we try the
troops from the outside?”</p>

<p>“Eet would be of no use whatever, Meester
Chadwick, and that’s the Laird’s own truth.
There’s one way to drive those rascally rebels to
the woods, though.”</p>

<p>“And how is that?”</p>

<p>“To get the government troops on the inside.
We could cut the rebels up a bit wi’ the machine
gun and put the fear of the Laird in their hearts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>,
and then charge ’em from inside the stockade.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but how are you going to march your
troops through the rebel ranks? You admit yourself
that it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to get them inside by marching
through the rebel ranks; but,” he paused impressively
as if to give his words weight, “there’s
another way, d’ye ken?”</p>

<p>“Another way of getting inside the stockade?”</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s what I’m tellin’ you, mon. Long,
long ago, d’ye ken, the Spaniards worked that
mine. They worked it pretty thoroughly, too, in
their primitive way; that cliff is fair honeycombed
wi’ passages an’ such.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, go on, Jameson; every minute is
precious.”</p>

<p>They all leaned forward eagerly as the raw-boned
Scot, not in the least perturbed, went
leisurely on.</p>

<small>THE “WHITE SHARK” TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>Not to try our reader’s patience as sorely as
Jameson tried that of his auditors, we will put
his narrative in brief form. In exploring the
abandoned passages of the mine workings, he one
day came upon a flight of steps cut in the rock.
He followed them up and found that they led
from the summit of the cliff down into the interior
of one of the big basalt caves. The mouth
of the cave was large, for he could see the gleam
of green water framed by the black rock, but the
free space above the entrance was hardly large
enough to admit a rowboat at high tide. Being
naturally of a curious disposition, he made soundings
and found that the water in the cave was
very deep, as deep as it was outside, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>“I’m no guessin’ what the old Spaniards used
the cave for,” he concluded; “to drown slaves that
had been cantankerous, maybe—I’ve heard o’
such things. But we can use it to a better purpose
the night—to save human lives.”</p>

<p>“I confess I don’t quite understand,” said Mr.
Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Hoot, mon, ye fash me. This bit boat is a
divin’ boat, is she nae?”</p>

<p>“She surely is,” spoke up Jack.</p>

<p>“Weel, then, you run doon the coast to the barracks
above Santiago, pack your soldier laddies
in this cabin when you get to the cave mouth, and
then dive into it.”</p>

<p>“Jove, Jameson man, I see your plan!” cried
Mr. Chadwick excitedly. “You mean to get the
soldiers inside the cave and then rush them into
the stockade by means of the secret stairway.”</p>

<p>“Preecisely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>“Then let’s start at once. Dancer, you think
the plan is feasible?”</p>

<p>“If there is sufficient water,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer for thot,” Jameson promised him.
“I made thorough soundings.”</p>

<p>“Let’s start right off, then. Every instant
counts. Dancer, will you go below to the wheel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll take it. It will be a delicate task getting
into that cave, but luckily, our searchlight
observation tube will help us.”</p>

<p>“How long will it take us to run down the coast
to the barracks, Jameson?” asked Mr. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Not more than an hour. How fast can ye
go?”</p>

<p>He was told.</p>

<p>“Then ye’ll do it in less time than that in the
bonnie bit divin’ boat.”</p>

<p>The engines were started at once, and at top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
speed they set off for the barracks where the
regular troops were quartered.</p>

<p>“I wish we had a dozen marines off the old
<i>Ohio</i>,” grumbled old Silas as they sped along,
“they’d lick all the rebels that ever breathed.”</p>

<p>“What, all of them, Silas?” asked Tom, winking
at Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, they wouldn’t leave more than a corporal’s
guard at any rate,” declared Silas confidently.</p>

<p>At last the light that marked the entrance of
the harbor where the barracks were located came
in sight. Mr. Jameson went below to help pilot
the craft in. They came to anchor and summoned
the attention of the sentry by three harsh toots of
the whistle. A sharp challenge followed, which
the superintendent answered in Spanish.</p>

<p>Jameson’s boat had been towed along, and it
now came in handy to take Mr. Chadwick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
the superintendent ashore. In less than fifteen
minutes it was back, loaded down dangerously
close to the bulwarks with Cuban soldiers under
a very young and voluble officer. They were
odd-looking chaps to the boys’ eyes, accustomed
to associate the name soldier with smart uniforms
and well-drilled figures. The Cubans were
slouchy and badly drilled and disciplined, talking
back to their officers freely. But they looked
wiry and were no doubt well adapted for the type
of fighting they were called on to do.</p>

<p>The boat made three trips ashore and back,
and at the end of her last trip there was packed
on board the submarine a complement of twenty
men under three officers.</p>

<p>These were all that could be spared, for the
garrison itself was in fear of an attack by the
rebels, who had become heated by several recent
victories. No time was lost in making a start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
back. The Cubans paled a little at the idea of
making a trip in a submarine, but their officers
reassured them that all was well.</p>

<p>Jameson bent over Mr. Dancer as they neared
the spot where the entrance to the cave was located.
At last they reached it. Word was given
to close the sliding hatch and make everything
fast.</p>

<p>Some of the Cubans who understood a little
English turned green and shook visibly from
fright as they heard these orders given. They
knew that they were about to dive under the sea
for some purpose, but for what they luckily didn’t
guess, or they might have been even more frightened.
Their officers reassured them with sharp
words of command.</p>

<p>“Gee! what a seasick-looking lot of monkeys,”
commented Silas Hardtack with disgust as he el<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>bowed
his way forward among their packed
ranks.</p>

<p>“Every man to his trade, Silas,” admonished
Mr. Chadwick, who had overheard.</p>

<p>“Ready for a dive!”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye!” boomed back from the engine
room in response to the hail from the steering
compartment.</p>

<p>“Stand by, everybody!” roared Silas in a voice
that had weathered many a gale. “You monkeys
better grab something,” he said to the Cubans,
“or you’ll get something you don’t expect.”</p>

<p>The next instant came the motion with which
all on board but the Cubans were now thoroughly
familiar. Down shot the <i>White Shark</i>.</p>

<p>Down! Down! Down!</p>

<p>A wail of terror went up from the Cubans.
Shouts to the saints and their friends rent the air.</p>

<p>“We are sinking, Jose!” yelled one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t think you was going up in a
balloon, did you?” grated out Silas.</p>

<p>“Muerto! I am killed!” cried another in agonized
tones.</p>

<p>The officers stood firm amidst all the yells and
lamentations, but their eyes blinked a little and
they looked anything but comfortable. Nor can
they be altogether blamed. Picture yourself,
reader, routed out of a comfortable bed to go
on a diving expedition in a boat that you had no
means of knowing would ever reappear on the
surface.</p>

<p>But at length the diving motion ceased and the
<i>White Shark</i> came up on an even keel.</p>

<p>“Clang! Clang!”</p>

<p>“Stop her!” boomed out in the engine room.</p>

<p>“Back her!”</p>

<p>“Come ahead—slow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>“Thank gracious that’s over,” breathed Jack as
he shut down the motors and wiped his hands on
a bit of waste, “I expected every minute to feel
us hit the side of the cave as we dived, and then—good
night!”</p>

<p>“It reminded me of coming through that hole
in the reef.”</p>

<p>“Almost as uncomfortable,” agreed Jack, “but
hark! There’s Silas opening the hatch. We’re
not needed here, let’s go on deck.”</p>

<p>They found the <i>White Shark</i> lying in an immense
pool of water almost crystal clear. Above
them rose the rocky dome of a huge cave. All
this was illumined by a powerful light which Silas
had been ordered to carry on deck.</p>

<p>The <i>White Shark</i> lay against a sort of platform
of stone from which the stairs upon which
Mr. Jameson had blundered appeared quite
plainly leading up to regions above.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
“Well, we’ve been in some queer places,” declared
Jack, “but this has it a little bit on all of
them. Look at those stalactites hanging from
the roof. They’re as big as telegraph poles.”</p>

<p>“Young telegraph poles,” reproved Tom,
laughing at Jack’s exaggeration.</p>

<p>The soldiers were quickly disembarked and
right glad they were to get their feet on dry land
again, although some of them looked misgivingly
about them at their odd surroundings. They chattered
like so many monkeys till ordered to fall in
by their officers.</p>

<p>“What’s he telling them to do?” asked Tom of
Silas, who understood some Spanish.</p>

<p>“He’s telling ’em to fall in. On the old <i>Ohio</i>——”</p>

<p>“Fall in? Fall in where?” demanded Tom with
a cherubic look of innocence.</p>

<p>“Into the pool,” supplemented Jack with a wink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
at Tom. But Silas had stalked off full of offended
dignity.</p>

<p>As he went he muttered something about what
was done to “fresh kids” on the old <i>Ohio</i>.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Jameson’s guidance the troops
marched off up the old stairway which, as Jameson
had hinted, the Spaniards had used for dark
purposes. The rest followed behind. The two
boys, half wild with excitement, brought up the
rear, having been admonished by Mr. Chadwick
to keep out of danger. As for Jupe, he lay under
his bunk. The red lights, the soldiers and the
mysterious cave had been too much for him.</p>

<p>As they emerged into the stockade, the haggard-faced
defenders of the place looked at them
as if they had been angels from heaven. One of
the men stated that through a peephole in the
stockade he had seen the rebels outside massing as
if to make a charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>“Then we are just in time, laddie,” said Mr.
Jameson. “Some of you mount the machine gun
and open fire, then the troops will follow up. Give
a few cheers, just to show them outside that
you’ve got plenty of heart left in you.”</p>

<p>The machine gun stood on a platform just inside
the stockade. Only its muzzle projected, but
as quite a big hole had been cut so as to give it
plenty of “range,” the operator was protected by
a steel “barbette.” As the cheer died down the
gun began to bark. It roared and spat like a
packet of fire crackers. Howls and yells told of
the dismay of the rebels.</p>

<p>“Now!” roared Jameson, who had been looking
through the peephole.</p>

<p>The gates were flung open and out dashed the
troops, while white fire was burned to illumine
the scene. But the sight of the troops was
enough. Unable to understand how the regulars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
had got within the stockade, the superstitious
rebels saw something supernatural in it. They
broke and fled in all directions, while the regulars,
with a great hullabaloo and show of ferocity,
chased them.</p>

<p>And after all, nobody was killed. The machine
had wounded a few of the rebels, but these had
been carried off by their friends. In fact, the
rebels had taken good care to keep out of the
machine gun’s way. That was not their style of
fighting.</p>

<p>It was the next day after the <i>White Shark</i> had
been backed out of the cave successfully that the
cruiser <i>Dixie</i> appeared, having steamed full speed
from Santiago, where her officers had learned of
the attack on the mine. Twenty marines were
landed further down the coast and placed in defense
of the workings till the revolution was over,
which event was not far off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>With her mission accomplished and her every
faculty tested, the <i>White Shark</i> shortly thereafter
left Cuba for the United States. On board she
carried a happy, contented crew who had gone
through much excitement and some hardship.
But not one was the worse for it. All enjoyed
radiant health and spirits.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dancer returned home, it was to
find that glorious news awaited him. It concerned
the <i>White Shark</i> and her type of submarine,
and from that day on the name of Daniel
Dancer became one of the most famous in the
history of his particular line of work. Moreover,
he—but that is another story.</p>

<p>You may rest assured that our friends did not
lose sight of each other at the conclusion of a
voyage which as even Jupe declared had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
“conlubrious fo’ all consarned in the contraption”;
meaning probably “salubrious for all concerned
in the transactions.”</p>

<p>And now the time has come to say good-bye
once more to our Boy Inventors. But of their
further activities and adventures you may read in
a forthcoming volume which will deal with other
experiments and inventions. For, not content
with what they had already achieved, the cousins
determined to convert their already famous automobile
into a machine of triple power and purpose.
Their success, and the utterly unexpected
experiences incident to it, is recorded in “The
Boy Inventors’ Flying Ship.”</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
